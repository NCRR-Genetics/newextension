# Schedule {#sec-schedule}

The course is structured as a series of participatory live-coding
sessions interspersed with hands-on exercises and group work, using
either a practice dataset or some other real-world dataset. There are
some lectures given, mainly at the start and end of the course. The
general schedule outline is shown in the below table. This is not a
fixed schedule of the timings of each session --- some may be shorter
and others may be longer. Instead, it is meant to be an approximate
guide and overview.

```{r schedule-table, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
options(knitr.kable.NA = "")
library(dplyr)
library(gt)
fa_link <- function(icon, link) {
    if (icon == "")
        return(html(""))
    html(paste0("<a href=\"", link, "\">", as.character(fontawesome::fa(icon, fill = "#2471a3")), "</a>"))
}
schedule <- readr::read_csv(here::here("resources/schedule.csv"),
                            col_types = "ccccc") %>% 
        mutate(across(everything(), ~if_else(is.na(.x), "", .x))) %>% 
        mutate(Links = purrr::map2(icon, link, fa_link)) %>% 
        select(-icon, -link)

schedule %>%
    gt(groupname_col = "Day",
       caption = "General schedule for the 3 days of the course.") %>%
    tab_style(style = list(cell_text(weight = "bold")),
              locations = cells_row_groups()) %>%
    tab_style(style = list(cell_text(weight = "bold")),
              locations = cells_column_labels())
```
