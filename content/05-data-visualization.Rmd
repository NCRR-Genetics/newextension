**Session objectives**:

1. Learn and apply the basics of creating publication-quality graphs.
1. Learn the importance of considering the colours you use in your graphs
and apply tools that are colour-blind friendly.
1. Learn why to avoid using commonly used, but inappropriate, graphs for presenting results.
1. Create useful graphs such as boxplots, scatterplots, line graphs,
jitter plots, and (appropriate) barplots.

## Basic principles for creating graphs

**Please take ~10 min to read through this section, as well as the next one**.

Making graphs in R is surprisingly easy and can be done with very little code.
Because of the ease with which you can make them,
it gives you some time to consider: *why* you are making them;
whether the graph you've selected is the *most appropriate* for your data or results;
and how you can design your graphs to be as accessible 
and understandable as possible.

To start, here are some tips for making a graph:

- Whenever possible or reasonable, show raw data values rather than summaries 
(e.g. means).
- Though commonly used in scientific papers, 
*[avoid barplots]* with means and error bars as they greatly misrepresent the data
(we'll cover why later).
- Use colour to highlight and enhance your message, and make the plot visually appealing.
- Use a colour-blind friendly palette to make the plot more accessible to others
(more on this later too).

There are also excellent online books on this that are included in the 
[resources](resources.html) chapter.

## Basic structure of using ggplot2

ggplot2 is an implementation of the ["Grammar of Graphics"](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387245447) (gg). 
This is a powerful approach to creating plots 
because it provides a set of structured rules (a "grammar") 
that allow you to expressively describe components (or "layers") of a graph.
Since you are able to describe the components,
it is easier to then implement those "descriptions" in creating a graph.
There are at least four aspects to using ggplot2 that relate to its "grammar":

- Aesthetics, `aes()`: How data are mapped to the plot, including what
data are put on the x and y axes, 
and/or whether to use a colour for a variable.
- Geometries, `geom_` functions: Visual representation of the data, as a
layer. This tells ggplot2 how the aesthetics should be visualized, including whether they should be shown as points, lines, boxes, bins, or bars.
- Scales, `scale_` functions: Controls the visual properties of the `geom_` layers.
Can be used to modify the appearance of the axes, to change the colour of dots from, e.g., red to blue, or to use a different colour palette entirely.
- Themes, `theme_` functions or `theme()`: Directly controls all other aspects of the plot, such as the size, font, and angle of axis text, and the thickness or colour of the axis lines.

There is a massive amount of features in ggplot2.
Thankfully, ggplot2 was specifically designed to make it easy to find 
and use its functions and settings using tab auto-completion.
To demonstrate this feature, try typing out `geom_` and then hitting tab. You will get a list of all the geoms available.
You can use this with `scale_` or the options inside `theme()`. Try typing out `theme(axis.` and then hiting tab, 
and a list of theme settings related to the axis will pop up.

So, why do we teach ggplot2 and not base R plotting?
Base R plotting functionality is quite good and you can make really nice
publication-quality graphs.
However, there are several major limitations to base R plots from a beginner
and a user-interface perspective: 

- Function and argument names are inconsistent 
and opaque (e.g. the `cex` argument can be used to magnify text and symbols, 
but you can't immediately tell from the name that it does that).
- User-friendly documentation that is accessible to a broad range of people
is not much of a priority, 
so often the help documentation isn't written with beginners in mind.
- Graphs are built similar to painting on a canvas; make a mistake and you need to start all over (e.g. restart R).

These limitations are due to the fact that base R plotting was developed:

- By different people over different periods of time.
- By people who were/are mostly from statistics and maths backgrounds.
- By people who (generally) don't have training in principles of
software user-design, user-interface, or engineering.
- Without a strong "design philosophy" to guide development.
- During a time when auto-completion didn't really exist or was sub-optimal,
so short function and object names were more important than they are today.

On the other hand, ggplot2:

- Has excellent documentation for help and learning.
- Has a strong design philosophy that makes it easier to use.
- Works in "layers", so you don't have to start over if you make a mistake.
- Works very well with auto-completion.
- Uses function and argument naming that is consistent and *descriptive* (in plain English).

These are the reasons we teach and use ggplot2. 

## Graph individual variables

**Let's make our first graphs together now**.

Very often you want to get a sense of your data, 
one variable (i.e. column in a data frame) at a time.
You create plots to see the distribution of a variable
and visually inspect the data for any problems.
There are several ways of plotting continuous variables 
(e.g. weight or height) in ggplot2. 
For discrete variables (e.g. "male" and "female"), 
there is really only one way. 

You may notice that, since the [data wrangling chapter](wrangling),
we have been using the term "column" to describe the columns in the data frame,
but from this point forward, we will instead refer to "variable".
There's a reason for this: ggplot2 really only works with tidy data.
If we recall the definition of tidy data,
it consists of "variables" (columns) and "observations" (rows) of a data frame.
To us, a "variable" is something that we are interested in analyzing or visualizing, 
and which only contains values relevant to that measurement
(e.g. `Weight` variable must only contain values for weight).

The `NHANES` dataset is already pretty tidy:
rows are participants at the survey year, and
columns are the variables that were measured.

Let's visually explore our data. 
In the `LearningR` project, create a new R
Markdown file called
`visualization-session.Rmd`. To do this, go to `File -> New File -> R
Markdown`. Enter "Data visualization" as
the title and your name as the author. Choose HTML as the output
format. When the file is created, keep
the YAML header but delete all the text and code chunks. Save the file as
`visualization-session.Rmd` in the `doc/` folder. We will use this file for
the code-along exercises in this session.

We need to load the packages and dataset, so we will add a new code chunk by either using the shortcut `Ctrl-Alt-I` or the menu
item `Code -> Insert Chunk`. Name the new chunk label as `setup` and then add
this to the first code chunk:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Load packages
source(here::here("R/package-loading.R"))

# Load the small, tidied dataset from the wrangling session
load(here::here("data/nhanes_small.rda"))
```

Now, we are ready to start creating the first plot! 
Since BMI is a strong risk factor for diabetes, let's check out the distribution of BMI among the participants.
There are two good geoms for examining distributions: 
`geom_density()` and `geom_histogram()`.

It is good practice to create a new code chunk for each plot in R Markdown, to maintain
a nice readable code, however, in this session, we are going to experiment with parameters and geoms and will not create a new code chunk for every plot we make. Write out a new header called `# One variable plots` in the free text area after the setup code chunk. Then add a new code
chunk below it and name it `continuous-variables`. Let's take a look at a density distribution plot:

```{r continuous-variables}
# Create density plot for BMI
ggplot(nhanes_small, aes(x = bmi)) +
    geom_density()
```

Now, let's take a look at a histogram, by typing in the same code chunk:

```{r}
# Create histogram for BMI
ggplot(nhanes_small, aes(x = bmi)) +
    geom_histogram()
```

Note that it is good practice to always create a new line after the `+`.
Our plot shows that, for the most part, there is a good distribution with BMI,
although there are several values that are quite large, including some at 80 BMI units!

The geoms above are appropriate for plotting continuous variables, 
but what about plotting discrete variables?
Well, sadly, there's really only one: `geom_bar()`.
This isn't a geom for a barplot though; instead, it shows the counts of a discrete variable.
There are many discrete variables in NHANES, including sex and diabetes, 
so let's use this geom to visualize those. 
Again, create a new code chunk, name it `discrete-variables`, then type:

```{r discrete-variables}
# Create count barplot for sex
ggplot(nhanes_small, aes(x = sex)) +
    geom_bar()
```

We can see that there are almost equal numbers of females and males.
Now, we'll do the same for the diabetes status variable. In the same code chunk, type:

```{r}
# Create count barplot for diabetes status
ggplot(nhanes_small, aes(x = diabetes)) +
    geom_bar()
```

For diabetes, it seems that there is some missingness in the data.
Since diabetes status is an important variable for us, let's remove all missing
values, save the tidied dataset in the `data/` folder, and plot it again
in a new code chunk named `remove-missing-diabetes`.

```{r remove-missing-diabetes}
# Remove individuals with missing diabetes status
nhanes_tidied <- nhanes_small %>% 
    filter(!is.na(diabetes))

# Save the tidied dataset as an rda file in the data folder
usethis::use_data(nhanes_tidied, overwrite = TRUE)

# Create a new count barplot for diabetes status
ggplot(nhanes_tidied, aes(x = diabetes)) +
    geom_bar()
```

Let's take a minute to talk about commonly used barplots with mean and error bars.
In all cases, barplots should **only** be used for discrete (categorical) data
where you want to show counts or proportions. As a general rule, they should **not** be used for continuous data.
This is because the commonly used "bar plot of means with error bars" 
actually hides the underlying distribution of the data.
To have a better explanation of this,
you can read the article on why to [avoid barplots] after the course. 
The image below was taken from that paper, and 
briefly demonstrates why this plot type is not useful. 

```{r barplots-deceive, fig.cap="Bars deceive what the data actually look like. Image sourced from a [PLoS Biology article](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002128).", echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images/barplots-deceive.png"))
```

If you *do* want to create a barplot, 
you'll quickly find out that it is actually quite hard to do in ggplot2.
The reason it is difficult to create in ggplot2 is by design:
it's a bad plot to use, so use something else.

```{r image-art-bar-error-plot, fig.cap="Barplots hide interesting results. Artwork by [\\@allison_horst](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations).", echo=FALSE, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images/art-bar-error-plot.png"))
```

Before we move on, let’s add and commit the new files we created into the Git history and push up to your GitHub repository.

## Plotting two variables

There are many more types of "geoms" to use when plotting two variables.
Your choice of which one to use depends on what you are trying to show
or communicate, and the nature of the data. 
Usually, the variable that you "control or influence" 
(the independent variable) in an experimental setting goes on the x-axis,
and the variable that "responds" (the dependent variable)
goes on the y-axis.

When you have *two continuous* variables, some geoms to use are:

- `geom_point()`, which is used to create a standard scatterplot.
- `geom_hex()`, which is used to replace `geom_point()` 
when your data are *massive* and creating points 
for each value takes too long to plot.
- `geom_smooth()`, which applies a "regression-type" line to the data
(default uses LOESS regression).

Let's check out how BMI may influence cholesterol using a basic scatterplot,
hex plot, and a smoothing line plot in a new code chunk. 

First, enter a new Markdown header called `# Plotting two variables` and create a 
code chunk named `2-continuous-variables` below that.

```{r 2-continuous-variables}
# Using 2 continuous variables
bmi_chol <- ggplot(nhanes_tidied, aes(x = bmi, y = tot_chol))
# Standard scatter plot
bmi_chol + 
    geom_point()
```    

You can see that, with 10,000 data points, the scatterplot is a little crowded.
To try a more suitable `geom_`, type in the same code chunk:

```{r}
# Standard scatter plot, but with hexagons
bmi_chol + 
    geom_hex()
```   

Notice how the hex plot changes the colour of the data 
based on how many values are in the area of the plot.

You can also draw a smoothing line:

```{r}
# Runs a smoothing line with confidence interval
bmi_chol + 
    geom_smooth()
```

This makes a nice smoothing line through the data and gives us an idea of
general trends or relationships between the two variables. You can also combine
geoms by adding another one with a `+`.

```{r}
# Or combine two geoms, hex plot with smoothing line
bmi_chol + 
    geom_hex() +
    geom_smooth()
```

### Two discrete variables

Sadly, there are not many options available for plotting two discrete variables, without major data wrangling. 
The most useful geom for this type of plot is `geom_bar()`, 
but with an added variable.
We can use the `geom_bar()` "fill" option to have a certain colour for different levels of a variable.
Let's use this to see difference in diabetes status between the sexes. Create a new code chunk named `2-discrete-variables` and type:

```{r 2-discrete-variables}
# Two categorical/discrete variables
# Note that we can pipe data into ggplot
two_discrete <- nhanes_tidied %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = diabetes, fill = sex)) 

# Stacked
two_discrete + 
    geom_bar()
```

By default, `geom_bar()` will make "fill" groups stacked on top of each other.
In this case, it isn't really that useful, so let's change them to be sitting side by side. 
For that, we need to use the `position` argument with a function called
`position_dodge()`.
This new function takes the "fill" grouping variable and "dodges" them 
(moves them) to be side by side.

```{r}
# "dodged" (side-by-side) bar plot
two_discrete + 
    geom_bar(position = position_dodge())
```

Now you can see that there are slightly more men that have diabetes than women.

### Discrete and continuous variables

When the variable types are mixed (continuous and discrete),
there are many more geoms available to use.
A couple of good ones are:

- `geom_boxplot()`, which makes boxplots that show the median 
and a measure of range in the data. 
Boxplots are generally pretty good at showing the spread of data.
- `geom_jitter()`, which makes a type of scatterplot, 
but for discrete and continuous variables. 
A useful argument to `geom_jitter()` is `width`,
which controls how wide the jittered points span from the center line.
This plot is much better than the boxplot since it shows the *actual data*,
and not summaries like a boxplot does.
However, it is not very good when you have lots of data points.
- `geom_violin()`, which shows a density distribution like `geom_density()`.
This geom is great when there is a lot of data 
and `geom_jitter()` may otherwise appear as a mass of dots.

Let's take a look at these geoms, by plotting how BMI differs between those with or without diabetes. In a new code chunk named `discrete-continuous-variables`, type:

```{r discrete-continuous-variables}
# Using mixed data
two_mixed <- nhanes_tidied %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = diabetes, y = bmi))

# Standard boxplot with outliers
two_mixed + 
    geom_boxplot()
```

However, the boxplot is still hiding your actual data points. Instead, data points can be shown
with a jitter plot:

```{r}
# Show the actual data using a jitter plot
two_mixed + 
    geom_jitter()
```

Or a violin plot:

```{r}
# Show the distribution with a violin plot
two_mixed + 
    geom_violin()
```

The violin plot kind of looks like two stingrays, eh?
Before proceeding with the following exercise, take a moment to add
and commit changes to the Git history, and then push to Github. 
Also, notice the document outline now has a nice index of how to plot the different data types!

## Exercise: Creating plots with one or two variables

Time: 15 min

Create a new header in the R Markdown file called `# Exercise to make plots with
one or two variables`, followed by a new code chunk.

Copy and paste the below code into that code chunk.

```{r exercise-2-var-plots, eval=FALSE}
# 1a. Distribution of age
ggplot(___, aes(x = ___)) +
    ___()
    
# 1b. Distribution of age of diabetes diagnosis
ggplot(___, aes(x = ___)) +
    ___()

# 2a. Number of people who smoke now
ggplot(___, aes(x = ___)) +
    ___()

# 2b. Number of people who are physically active
ggplot(___, aes(x = ___)) +
    ___()

# 3a. BMI in relation to systolic blood pressure
ggplot(___, aes(x = ___, y = ___)) +
    ___()

# 3b. BMI relation to diastolic blood pressure
ggplot(___, aes(x = ___, y = ___)) +
    ___()
    
# 4. Physically active people with or without diabetes
ggplot(___, aes(x = ___, fill = ___)) +
    ___(___ = ___())

# 5. Poverty levels between those with or without diabetes
ggplot(___, aes(x = ___, y = ___)) +
    ___()
```

Complete as many tasks as you can below.

1. Using `geom_histogram()`, find out what the distribution is for the two variables below.
    a. `age` (participant's age at collection).
    b. `diabetes_age` (age of diabetes diagnosis).
2. Using `geom_bar()`, find out how many people have data recorded for each of the two discrete variables below.
What can you say about most people for these variables?
    a. `smoke_now` (current smoking status).
    b. `phys_active` (does moderate to vigorous physical activity).
3. Using `geom_hex()`, find out how BMI relates to the two blood pressure variables below.
Do you notice anything about the data from the plots?
    a. `bp_sys_ave` (average systolic blood pressure).
    b. `bp_dia_ave` (average diastolic blood pressure).
4. Using `geom_bar()`, find out how `phys_active` those with or without `diabetes` are.
Put `diabetes` on the x-axis.
What can you say based on the data? 
Note the differences in missingness between groups.
Don't forget to use `position_dodge()` in the `position` argument, in order to arrange the bars side by side.
7. Using `geom_violin()`, 
find how `poverty` levels are different for those with or without `diabetes`.
Put `diabetes` on the x-axis.
Looking at the distributions, 
what can you conclude about how poverty may be associated with diabetes status?
    - The `poverty` variable is calculated as a ratio between income and a poverty threshold. 
    Smaller numbers mean higher poverty.
8. Save, add, and commit the changes to the
Git history.

```{r solution-2-var-plots, eval=FALSE, solution=TRUE}
# 1a. Distribution of age
ggplot(nhanes_tidied, aes(x = age)) +
    geom_histogram()
    
# 1b. Distribution of age at diabetes diagnosis
ggplot(nhanes_tidied, aes(x = diabetes_age)) +
    geom_histogram()

# 2a. Number of people who smoke now
ggplot(nhanes_tidied, aes(x = smoke_now)) +
    geom_bar()

# 2b. Number of people who are physically active
ggplot(nhanes_tidied, aes(x = phys_active)) +
    geom_bar()

# 3a. BMI in relation to systolic blood pressure
ggplot(nhanes_tidied, aes(x = bmi, y = bp_sys_ave)) +
    geom_hex()

# 3b. BMI relation to diastolic blood pressure
ggplot(nhanes_tidied, aes(x = bmi, y = bp_dia_ave)) +
    geom_hex()
    
# 4. Physically active people with or without diabetes
ggplot(nhanes_tidied, aes(x = diabetes, fill = phys_active)) +
    geom_bar(position = position_dodge())

# 5. Poverty levels between those with or without diabetes
ggplot(nhanes_tidied, aes(x = diabetes, y = poverty)) +
    geom_violin()
```

## Visualizing three or more variables

There are many ways to visualize additional variables in a plot 
and further explore your data.
For that, we can use ggplot2's colour, shape, size, transparency ("alpha"), 
and fill aesthetics, as well as "facets".
Faceting in ggplot2 is a way of splitting the plot up into multiple plots 
when the underlying aesthetics are the same or similar. 
In this section, we'll be covering many of these capabilities in ggplot2.

The most common and "prettiest" way of adding a third variable is by using colour.
Let's try to answer a few of the questions below, to visualize some of these features.
First, create a new header called `# Plotting three or more variables`
and a code chunk named `using-colour` below it.

*Question: Is systolic blood pressure different in those with 
or without diabetes in females and males?*
In this case, we have one continuous variable (`bp_sys_ave`)
and two discrete variables (`sex` and `diabetes`).
To plot this, we could use `geom_boxplot()`:

```{r using-colour}
# Plot systolic blood pressure in relation to sex and diabetes status
nhanes_tidied %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = sex, y = bp_sys_ave, colour = diabetes)) +
    geom_boxplot()
```

Do you see differences in systolic blood pressure between the sexes? Between diabetics and non-diabetics?

*Question: How does BMI relate to systolic blood pressure 
and age?*
Here, we have three continuous variables (`bmi`, `bp_sys_ave`, and `age`),
so we could use `geom_point()`:

```{r}
# Plot BMI in relation to systolic blood pressure and age
nhanes_tidied %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = bmi, y = bp_sys_ave, colour = age)) +
    geom_point()
```

Can you see any associations between systolic blood pressure and BMI or age?

*Question: How does BMI relate to systolic blood pressure, 
and what is different between those with and without diabetes?*
In this case, we have two continuous variables (`bmi` and `bp_sys_ave`) and one discrete variable (`diabetes`).
We could use `geom_point()`:

```{r}
# Plot BMI in relation to systolic blood pressure and diabetes status
nhanes_tidied %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = bmi, y = bp_sys_ave, colour = diabetes)) +
    geom_point()
```

For this latter plot, it's really hard to see what's different. 
But there is another way of visualizing a third (or fourth, and fifth) variable:
with "faceting"!
Faceting splits the plot up into multiple subplots
using the function `facet_grid()`.
For faceting to work, at least one of the first two arguments to `facet_grid()` is needed.
The first two arguments are:

- `cols`: The discrete variable to use to facet the plot column-wise 
(i.e. side-by-side).
- `rows`: The discrete variable to use to facet the plot row-wise 
(i.e. stacked on top of each other).

For both `cols` and `rows`, the nominated variable must be wrapped by `vars()`
(e.g. `vars(diabetes)`).
Let's try it using an example from the previous answer (instead of using `colour`).
Make a new code chunk named `using-faceting`

```{r using-faceting}
# Plot BMI in relation to systolic blood pressure and diabetes status using
# faceting by column
nhanes_tidied %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = bmi, y = bp_sys_ave)) +
    geom_point() +
    facet_grid(cols = vars(diabetes))
```

Try faceting with plots stacked by diabetes status, using the argument `rows =
vars(diabetes)` instead. Which do you find more informative?

```{r}
# faceting by row
nhanes_tidied %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = bmi, y = bp_sys_ave)) +
    geom_point() +
    facet_grid(rows = vars(diabetes))
```

We can also facet by `sex` and use `age` as a colour:

```{r}
# Plot BMI in relation to systolic blood pressure, age, sex and diabetes status
nhanes_tidied %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = bmi, y = bp_sys_ave, colour = age)) +
    geom_point() +
    facet_grid(rows = vars(diabetes),
               cols = vars(sex))
```

Before moving on, let's save the file, add and commit the new changes to the Git
history, and push to GitHub.

## Colours: Make your graphs more accessible

**Please take ~5 min to read through this section and then complete the exercise that follows.**

Colour blindness is common in the general population, 
with red-green colour blindness affecting about 8% of men 
and 0.5% of women. 
To make your graph more accessible to people with colour blindness,
you need to consider the colours you use.
For more detail on how colours look to those with colour blindness, 
check out this
[documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html) 
from the [viridis] package. 
The viridis colour scheme (also developed as an R package)
was specifically designed to represent data to all colour visions
(including as a grayscale, e.g. from black to white). 
There is a really informative 
[talk on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAoljeRJ3lU) on this topic.

[viridis]: https://cran.r-project.org/package=viridis

When using colours, think about what you are trying to convey in your figure 
and how your choice of colours will be interpreted. 
You can use built-in colour schemes or create your own. 
For now, let's stick to using built-in ones.
There are two we can start with: the viridis and the [ColorBrewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/) colour schemes. 
Both are well designed and are colour blind friendly.
For this course, we will only cover the viridis package.

## Exercise: Changing the colour schemes

Time: 10 min

Practice changing colour schemes on a bar plot. Start with a base plot object to work from that has two discrete variables. 
Create a new Markdown header called `# Exercise for changing colours` and create
a new code chunk named `exercise-discrete-variables` below it. Copy and paste the code below into the new code chunk.

```{r exercise-discrete-variables}
# Barplot to work from, with two discrete variables
base_barplot <- nhanes_tidied %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = diabetes, fill = sex)) +
    geom_bar(position = position_dodge())
```

Use the `scale_fill_` function set to add the colour scheme. If you need help,
use the `help()` or `?` functions in RStudio to look over the documentation 
for more information or to see the other `scale_` functions. Use tab auto-completion
to find the correct function.

1. Change the colour to the viridis scheme with the `scale_fill_viridis_d()` function
and use it on the `base_barplot` graph so that the plot is colour blind
friendly. Because the variables are discrete, you will need to add `_d` to the end of
the viridis scheme function.

2. Viridis has several palettes. Add the argument `option = "magma"` to the
`scale_fill_viridis_d()` function. Run the function again and see how the colour
changes. Next, change `"magma"` to `"cividis"`.

3. Now, let's practice using the colour schemes on a plot with continuous
variables. Copy and paste the code below into a new code chunk named `exercise-continuous-variables`.
Since we are using `colour` instead of `fill`, the `scale_` will be 
`scale_colour_viridis_c()`. The `_c` at the end indicates the variable will be
continuous.

    ```{r exercise-continuous-variables}
    # Scatterplot to work from, with three continuous variables
    base_scatterplot <- nhanes_tidied %>% 
        ggplot(aes(x = bmi, y = bp_sys_ave, colour = age)) +
        geom_point()
    ```
    
4. Similar to #2 above, use the `option` argument to set the palette to `"inferno"` 
and see how the colour changes.

5. Lastly, add and commit the changes to the R Markdown file into the Git history.

```{r solution-colour-schemes, eval=FALSE, solution=TRUE}
# 1. change colors to a viridis colour scheme
base_barplot +
    scale_fill_viridis_d()

# 2. change colours to another viridis color scheme
base_barplot +
    scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "magma")

base_barplot +
    scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "cividis")

# 3. change colours to a viridis color scheme
base_scatterplot +
    scale_color_viridis_c()

# 4. change colours to another viridis color scheme
base_scatterplot +
    scale_color_viridis_c(option = "inferno")
```

## Titles, axis labels, and themes

There are so many options in RStudio to modify a ggplot2 figure.
Almost all of them are found in the `theme()` function. 
We won't cover individual theme items,
since the `?theme` help page
and [ggplot2 theme webpage] already document `theme()` really well.
Instead, we'll cover a few of the built-in themes,
as well as setting the axes labels and plot title.
We'll build off of the previously created `base_scatterplot`.
All built-in themes start with `theme_`.

[ggplot2 theme webpage]: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/theme.html

Create a new section header called `# Changing plot appearance` 
and make a code chunk named `built-in-themes`, then copy the code below:

```{r built-in-themes}
# Create scatterplot to play with themes
base_scatterplot2 <- base_scatterplot +
    facet_grid(rows = vars(diabetes),
               cols = vars(sex)) +
    scale_color_viridis_c()

# View the plot with the default theme
base_scatterplot2
# Test out some pre-defined themes
base_scatterplot2 + theme_bw()
base_scatterplot2 + theme_minimal()
base_scatterplot2 + theme_classic()
```

You can also set the theme for all subsequent plots by using the `theme_set()`
function, and specifying the theme you want in the parenthesis.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Set the theme for all subsequent plots
theme_set(theme_bw())
```

To add labels such as axis titles to your plot, you can use the function `labs()`.
To change the y-axis title, use the `y` argument in `labs()`.
For the x-axis, it is `x`.
For the whole plot, it is `title`. Add a new code chunk named `labels` and type:

```{r labels}
# Add plot title and change axis titles
base_scatterplot2 +
    labs(title = "BMI, systolic blood pressure, and age by diabetes and sex",
         y = "Systolic Blood Pressure (mmHg)",
         x = "BMI (kg/m2)")
```

## Saving the plot

To save the plot you created, use the `ggsave()` function.
The first argument says where to save the graph. Give the name of the newly created file,
as well as the folder location.
The next argument says which plot to save.
At this point, you can set the dimensions of the figure 
using the `width` and `height` arguments.
Add a new section header `# Saving the plot` and create a new code chunk:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Save the plot
ggsave(here::here("doc/images/scatterplot.pdf"), 
       base_scatterplot2, width = 7, height = 5)
```

Lastly, let's save the R Markdown file, add and commit the changes, and push to
GitHub.

## Summary of session {#dataviz-summary}

- Use the "Grammar of Graphics" approach in conjunction with the ggplot2 package within the tidyverse to
plot your data.
- Prioritize plotting raw data instead of summaries whenever possible.
- ggplot2 has 4 levels of grammar: `aes()` (which data to plot), `geom_` (what
kind of plot), `scale_` (to make the plot pretty), and `theme()`
(to control the specifics of the plot).
- Only use barplots for discrete values. If applying them on continuous
variables, it hides the distribution of the data.
- To plot more dimensions, use colour, the X axis, the Y axis, or `facet_grid()`.
- Use colour blind-friendly palettes, such as `viridis`.
- Save plots using `ggsave()`.
