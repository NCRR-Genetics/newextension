The course is designed as a series of participatory live-coding lessons,
where the instructor and learner code together, along with reading
activities and hands-on practical exercises interspersed throughout the
course and a final group assignment to do a simple data analysis
project. This website contains all of the material for the course, from
reading material to exercises to code to images. It is structured as a
book, with "chapters" as lessons, given in order of appearance. We make
heavy use of the website throughout the course where code-along sessions
almost identically follow the material on the website (with slight
modifications for time or more detailed explanations).

The course material was created using [Quarto](https://quarto.org) to
write the lessons and create the book format,
[GitHub](https://github.com/) to host the [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
repository of the material, and [GitHub
Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) with
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to build and host the website. The
original source material for this course is found on the
[`r-cubed-intro`](https://github.com/rostools/r-cubed-intro) GitHub
repository.

## Target audiences

This website and its content are targeted to three groups:

1.  For the **learners** to use during the course, both to follow along
    in case they get lost and also to use as a reference after the
    course ends. The learner is someone who is currently or will soon
    actively be doing research (e.g. a PhD or postdoc), who is likely in
    biomedical research, and who has no or little knowledge on coding
    in R. A more detailed description of who the learner is can be found
    in @sec-is-it-for-you.
2.  For the **instructors** to use as a guide for when they do the
    code-along sessions and lectures.
3.  For those who are **interested in teaching**, who may not have much
    experience or may not know where to start, to use this website as a
    guide to running and instructing their own workshops.

Content from multiple sources was used as inspiration for this course,
including the [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) book and the
[Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/).

The [Danish Diabetes and Endocrinology
Academy](https://www.ddeacademy.dk/) has hosted, organized, and
sponsored running this course to researchers in Denmark versions
multiple times. A huge thanks to them for their involvement, support,
and sponsorship! Both [Steno Diabetes Center
Aarhus](https://www.stenoaarhus.dk/) and [Aarhus
University](https://www.au.dk/) are employers of Luke Johnston and
Daniel Witte (the initial founders and creators).
