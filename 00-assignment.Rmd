# Group project assignment {#assignment}

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/document%20status-in%20progress-orange?style=flat-square)

To maximize how much you learn and how much you will retain, 
you as a group will take what you learn in the course 
and apply it to create a reproducible project (as a GitHub repository) 
and report (as an HTML file) based on a (simple) data analysis of a dataset of your choice. 
The dataset **cannot be the same** as the one we used in class,
and must be an open dataset obtained from an online archive.

On the last day of the course, 
you will give a ~10 min presentation of your analysis and report.
During the presentation, you as a group will:

- Show your project on GitHub
- Show your generated HTML report
- Describe what you did and the reasons for why you did them
- Explain any challenges you encountered or things you would do differently
- Explain anything you liked and would do more of in the future

When your group isn't presenting, 
you as an audience member will participate in the discuss by:

- Asking questions to *clarify* any thing you may not understand or are confused about
- Give *constructive* feedback on what they could have improved on
- Give *concrete* suggestions on how they could handle the things they found challenging

## Specific tasks

Throughout the course, you will work together as a group on some exercises, 
especially the final exercise in each session. Before you do any tasks though,
decide as a group how you want to present the project at the end. 
We'd recommend having one or two people be the "presenters".

Then, for the group project, your specific tasks are to:

- Create a project (using the "New Project" setup or with the prodigenr package).
- Put the new project onto the GitHub repository assigned to your group.
- Find an open dataset to use for your analysis and report. 
The dataset can be on anything your group is interested in, 
but *must* be from an open and online data archive.
Choose a dataset that isn't too big (maybe *max* 4 Mb).
- Download the dataset and put it into the `data-raw/` folder of your project.
Add the dataset to your Git repository and upload it to GitHub.
- Create an R script inside `data-raw/` that cleans up and prepares the raw dataset.
Save the new dataset in a folder called `data/`.
- Create an R script in your `R/` folder that generates and saves one or more figures that
visualize the cleaned dataset. Save the figures in a folder called `images/` inside the
`doc/` folder.
- Create an R Markdown document called `report.Rmd` in the `doc/` folder of your project.
Do some simple analyses of the dataset in this report file.
    - Create a table in the report that is generated from the data.
    - Insert the generated figure into the report.
    - Create typical research section headers (e.g. "Introduction", "Results")
    - Write up a basic description of what you did in a "Methods" section.
    - Write up a few sentences on some things you liked about doing the project with
    the tools you learned and a few sentences on some challenges you had. 
    This can be done as a group.
- Generate an HTML of the report.
- Include all the updated code and files on GitHub.

These tasks may seem like a lot, with a lot of new terminology and tools to use. 
But don't worry! We will be going over many of these topics and you will have time
to complete the project over the three days.

## Expectations

What we expect:

- Used Git and GitHub throughout as you work on your project.
- Work collaboratively as a group and share responsibilities and tasks.
- That you demonstrate that you've learned the material by using as much as you
can from the course.

What we don't expect:

- Complicated analysis or coding. 
The simpler it is the easier is to for you and us to see that you've tried to use the tools.
- Clever or overly concise code. 
Clearly written and readable code is *always* better than clever or concise code.
Keep it simple and understandable!
