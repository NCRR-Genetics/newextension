# Group project assignment {#assignment}

To maximize how much you learn and how much you will retain, 
you as a group will take what you learn in the course 
and apply it to create a reproducible project (as a GitHub repository) 
and report (as an HTML file) based on a (simple) data analysis of a dataset of your choice. 
The dataset **cannot be the same** as the one we used in class,
and must be an open dataset obtained from an online archive (we recommend a few
below).

On the last day of the course, 
you as a group will give a ~10 min presentation of your analysis and report.
During the presentation, you as a group will:

- Show your project on GitHub
- Show your generated HTML report
- Describe what you did and the reasons for why you did them
- Explain any challenges you encountered or things you would do differently
- Explain anything you liked and would do more of in the future

When your group isn't presenting, 
you as an audience member *can* participate if you want in the discussion by:

- Asking questions to *clarify* anything you may not understand or are confused about
- Give *constructive* feedback on what they could have improved on
- Give *concrete* suggestions on how they could handle the things they found challenging

## Specific tasks

Throughout the course, you will work together as a group on some exercises, 
especially the final exercises in each session. Before you do any tasks though,
decide as a group who will present the project at the end. 
We'd recommend assigning one or two people to be the "presenters". 

It is important to note that you will be using Git and GitHub to manage your
group assignment, so you should take care to set this up correctly prior to
jumping in to the exercises. You are likely to push and pull a lot of content
(which you will learn how to do), so you will need to maintain regular and open
communication with your team members.

For the group project, your specific tasks (based on lesson order) are to:

1. **Create a new project** using the "New Project" setup with the necessary files
(covered in [Management of R Projects](r-project-management.html)) 
by using the prodigenr package.
    - Assign one person to make this project and act as the "coordinator" (necessary
    for the next task). In the [Version Control session](version-control.html), this
    person will use this project for the final exercise.
    - Name the project the *same* as your team name (which is given for your group).
    - Please assign one person as the "coordinator".
    - Run these functions from the usethis package to setup the project 
    and to create these files:

        ```r
        usethis::use_blank_slate()
        usethis::use_data_raw("original-data")
        usethis::use_r("generate-figures")
        ```

2. **Put the project under Git version control and upload to GitHub**.
    - The coordinator needs to add and commit all the files in the R Project.
    - The coordinator must connect the project to GitHub and push ("upload") the
    repository (covered in [Version Control](version-control.html)).
    - All other team members must clone their team's GitHub repository on their
    computers.
    - Each team must open up the `README.md` file and write a few sentences about
    themselves. After saving the changes, add and commit them into the Git repository.
    - Push and pull the changes and deal with the resulting merge conflicts.

3. **Find an open dataset** to use for your analysis and report. You have two
options here: 1) choose from one of the datasets provided below; or 2) search
for another dataset from an online data archive (e.g., FigShare). If you choose
the second option, make sure to select a dataset that isn't too big (maybe
*max.* 4 Mb) and contains some *basic* quantitative data that you can test some
basic functions on. **Don't** spend too much time on this task.
Here are some datasets we've identified that would be good for your assignment:
    - [Zika Virus Data](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/zika-data/blob/master/data/raw/paho-who/paho-who-cases-reported-latest.csv)
    - [FBI Firearm Stats](https://github.com/hchats/nics-firearm-background-checks/blob/master/data/nics-firearm-background-checks.csv)
    - [New York Squirrel Census Date](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2019/2019-10-29/nyc_squirrels.csv)
    - [Zindi.africa: Sea Turtle Rescue](https://gitlab.com/rostools/r-cubed/-/blob/master/datasets/turtles.zip)
    - [Zindi.africa: Busara Mental Health](https://gitlab.com/rostools/r-cubed/-/blob/master/datasets/rural_kenya.zip)
    - [Zindi.africa: Female-Headed Households in South Africa](https://gitlab.com/rostools/r-cubed/-/blob/master/datasets/rsa_wards.zip)
    - [Starbucks Menu Item Data](https://www.kaggle.com/starbucks/starbucks-menu) (May be required to create a Kaggle account)

4. **Download the dataset** and put it into the `data-raw/` folder of your
project. For the GitHub-linked datasets above, you should be able to click on the
"Raw" or "Download" buttons, then use the keyboard shortcut (`Ctrl-S`) to save
the page (as a .csv file). It is advised that you push/pull appropriately and
check that all team members can "see" the dataset. If you have documentation on
the dataset, e.g. variable definitions, put those files in the `data-raw/`
folder as well.

5. **Create an R script inside `data-raw/` that cleans up and prepares the raw dataset**
(as covered in [Data Management](wrangling.html)).
Save the new dataset in a folder called `data/`. Again, use your version control software to make and manage these changes. 

6. **Create an R Markdown file** named `report.Rmd` in the `doc/` folder of your project
(covered in [Reproducible Documents](reproducible-documents.html)).
Do some simple analyses of the dataset in this report file 
and do these tasks:
    - Create section headers (e.g. "Introduction", "Methods", "Results", "Discussion")
    - Write up a basic description of what the dataset is and where you got it
    and what you did to process or analyze the data in a "Methods" section.
    - Create a table in the report that is generated from the data in a "Results"
    section.
    
7. **Create R code chunks in the `report.Rmd` file that create 
one or more figures** to visualize the cleaned dataset 
(covered in [Data Visualization](visualization.html)). 
Save the figures in a folder called `images/` inside the `doc/` folder.

8. **Add discussion items to the `report.Rmd` file**:
    - Write up a few sentences on some things you liked about doing the project with
    the tools you learned and a few sentences on some challenges you had in a
    "Discussion" section.
    Add your thoughts as a group.

9. **Generate an HTML of the report** (but don't commit it to Git).

10. Include all the updated code and files on GitHub for the presentation.

These tasks may seem like a lot, with a lot of new terminology and tools to use. 
But don't worry! We will be going over many of these topics and you will have time
to complete the project over the three days.

At the end, the lead instructor will download each of the teams Git projects,
knit the R Markdown documents, 
and show them on the screen for each team to present on.

## Quick "checklist" for a "good" project

- Project on GitHub
- Used Git
- Included a good README describing the project and the team
- Separated "raw data" from "cleaned data"
- Used scripts to clean the data
- Included R code within an R Markdown file to show results and make figures
- Written about your methods, datasets
- Written about your challenges and general experiences
- Generated an HTML file from an R Markdown file

## Expectations for the project

What we expect you to do for the group project:

- Use Git and GitHub throughout your work.
- Work collaboratively as a group and share responsibilities and tasks.
- Use as much of what we covered in the course to practice what you learned.

What we don't expect:

- Complicated analysis or coding. 
The simpler it is the easier is to for you to do the coding 
and understand what is going on
and it helps us to see that you've practiced what you learned.
- Clever or overly concise code. 
Clearly written and readable code is *always* better than clever or concise code.
Keep it simple and understandable!

Essentially, the group project is a way to reinforce what you learned during the course,
but in a more relaxed and collaborative setting.
