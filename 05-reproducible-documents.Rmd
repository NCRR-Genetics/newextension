# Analytically reproducible documents {#reproducible-documents}

> When in RStudio, quickly jump to this page using `r3::open_reproducible_documents()`.

**Session objectives**:

1. Learn what a reproducible document is,
how R Markdown achieves being reproducible, 
and why it can save you time and effort
1. Write and use R code within a document,
so that it will automatically insert the R output into the final document.
1. Learn about and use Markdown formatting and syntax for writing documents.
1. Learn about and create different document types like HTML 
or Word from an R Markdown document.

## Why try to be reproducible?

**Take about 5 min to read over this section**.

Both reproducibility and replicability are cornerstones for doing rigorous 
and sound science. 
As we've learned, 
reproducibility in science is fairly lacking, 
which this course aims to fill. 
But being reproducible isn't just about doing better science, it can also:

1. Make you much more efficient and productive, as less time is spent between
coding and putting your results in a document (e.g. no need to copy and paste).
1. Make you more confident in your results, 
since what you report 
and show as figures or tables will be exactly what you get from your analysis. 
Again, no copying and pasting required!

Hopefully by the end of this session you'll try to start using R Markdown files
for writing your manuscripts and other technical documents. Believe us, 
after you've learned how to incorporate text with R code, 
it can save so much time in the end,
and make your analysis and work more reproducible. Plus you can create
some very aesthetically appealing reports, 
way more easily than you could if you did it in Word. 

## Creating an R Markdown file

**Take about 5 min to read over the next few paragraphs**.

R Markdown is a file format (a plain text format like R scripts or `.csv` files)
that allows you to be more reproducible in your analysis 
and to be more productive in general in your work.
R Markdown is a extension of [Markdown][pandoc] that integrates R code 
with written text (as Markdown formatting).

So what is Markdown? 
It is a [markup syntax] and formatting tool, like HTML,
that allows you write a document in plain text
that can then be converted into a vast range of other document types,
e.g. HTML, PDF, Word documents, slides, posters, or websites.
In fact, this website is built from R and Markdown! 
(Plus other things like HTML.) 
The Markdown used in R Markdown is based on [pandoc] 
("pan" means all and "doc" means document, so "all documents").
Pandoc is a very powerful, popular, 
and well-maintained software tool for document conversion. 
But, we'll get to Markdown more a bit later.
For now we're going to focus on the main reason to use it:
for incorporating R code and output into a document!
By using R code in a document, 
you can have a seamless integration between document writing 
and doing your analysis.

Why would you use this? There are many reasons, some of them being:

- There is less time between exploring a new dataset or analysis
and sharing your findings with collaborators,
because the writing and documenting is woven in with your R analysis code.
- If you finish an analysis and produce a report, 
but later find out there are problems with the data or you get new data,
updating your report is as easy as clicking a button to regenerate it.
- How you got and present your results is based on the exact sequence of steps
given in your R Markdown document,
so showing others on how the analysis is done is easy 
because the *how* is explicitly shown in the document.
- Likewise, by reading others' R Markdown documents,
it is easier to learn what was done in their analysis
because the logic and sequence is shown in the document itself.

[markup syntax]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language
[pandoc]: https://pandoc.org/index.html

**Let's go over this together**.

Ok, let's create and save an R Markdown file. 
Go to "File -> New File -> R Markdown",
and a dialog box will then pop up.
Type in "Reproducible documents" in the title section 
and your name in the author section. 
Choose HTML as the output format.
Then save this file as `rmarkdown-session.Rmd` in the `doc/` folder.

```{r video-rstudio-create-rmarkdown, echo=FALSE}
insert_video("videos/rstudio-create-rmarkdown.mp4")
```

We now have an R Markdown file.
Inside the file, there is some text that gives a brief overview of how to use it.
For now, let's ignore the text.

At the top of the R Markdown file,
you will see something that looks a bit like this:

```yaml
---
title: "Reproducible documents"
author: "Your Name"
date: "6/18/2020"
output: html_document
---
```

This section is called the *[YAML] header*
and it contains commands and metadata about the document.
Most Markdown documents have this YAML header at the top of the document
and they are always surrounded by `---` on the top and bottom of the section.
YAML is a data format that has the form of a `key: value` pairing to store data.
The keys in this case are `title`, `author`, `date`, and `output`.
The values are those that follow the key (e.g. "Your Name" for `author`).
In the case of R Markdown, these `key` data are used to store the settings 
that R Markdown will use to create the `output` document.
The keys listed above are some of many settings that R Markdown has available to use.

[YAML]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML

In the case of this YAML header, 
the R Markdown document will generate an HTML file because of the `output: html_document` setting.
You can also create a word document with `output: word_document`.
While PDF documents are also able to be created,
they require installing LaTeX through the R package [tinytex],
which can sometimes be complicated to install.
So we will only cover HTML and Word documents in this session.

[tinytex]: https://yihui.name/tinytex/r/

So how do we create an HTML (or Word) document from the R Markdown document?
By "knitting" it! At the top of the pane near the save button,
there is a button with the word "Knit" and yarn beside it, 
as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:image-rstudio-knit-button). 
To knit, you either click that button 
or by typing "Ctrl+Shift+K" anywhere in the R Markdown document.

```{r image-rstudio-knit-button, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Location of the Knit button in RStudio."}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images/rstudio-knit-button.png"))
```

When you click it, a bunch of commands should pop up in a new pane called "R Markdown",
followed by a new window popping up with the newly created document.
Alternatively, the HTML document may pop up in the "Viewer" pane.

Cool, so now you've created an HTML document!
Let's try making a Word document.
Change the YAML value in the key `output:` from `html_document` to `word_document`.
Then knit the document again (with the "Knit" button or with "Ctrl-Shift-K").
Now, a Word document should open up.
This is the basic approach to creating documents from R Markdown.

## Exercise: Create another R Markdown document. 

Time: 5 min

1. Create another R Markdown document using RStudio's interface.
    - Write the title as "Trying out R Markdown".
    - Choose "HTML" as the document type.
1. Save the document in the `doc/` folder and name it `another-one.Rmd`.
1. Knit the document with either "Ctrl-Shift-K" 
or with the RStudio "Knit" button.
1. Look at the output document, then change the YAML value for the `output:`
key from `html_document` to `word_document`. Knit again.
1. Open the Word file if it hasn't been opened already.

## Inserting R code into your document

Being able to insert R code directly into a document is one of the most 
powerful characteristics of using R Markdown.
This frees you from having to switch between programs when writing text
and when running R code in order to obtain an output 
that you'd then put into the document.

Running and including R code in R Markdown is done through "R code chunks".
You insert these chunks into the document by either typing "Ctrl+Alt+I" 
or using the menu item "Code -> Insert Chunk", 
with the cursor at the location you want the chunk to be.
Before we do that,
delete all the text in your R Markdown document (the `rmarkdown-session.Rmd` file),
excluding the YAML header.
Make sure that the YAML key `output:` is set to `html_document`.

Then, place your cursor two lines below the YAML header 
and insert a code chunk ("Ctrl+Alt+I" or "Code -> Insert Chunk").
The code chunk should look something like this:

````markdown
`r ''````{r}
 
`r ''````
````

In the code chunk, type out `2 + 2`, so it looks like:

````markdown
`r ''````{r}
2 + 2 
`r ''````
````

You can run R code inside the code chunk the same as you would when in an R script.
Typing "Ctrl+Enter" on the line will send the code `2 + 2` to the console,
putting the output directly below the code chunk in the R Markdown document.
This output though is temporary.

To get it inserted into the HTML document,
knit ("Ctrl+Shift+K") the document and see what happens in the created HTML document.
The output `4` should appear below the code chunk in the HTML document.
Something like this:

```{r}
2 + 2
```

This is a very simple example of how code chunks work.
Normally, things are more complicated than this though.
Usually we have to load R packages to use for running R,
and this is no different in an R Markdown document.
Create a new code chunk and then type `setup` right after the `r`.
It should look like:

````markdown
`r ''````{r setup}

`r ''````
````

This area that you typed in is for code chunk labels.
In this case, we labelled the code chunk with the name `setup`.
Code [chunk labels] should be named without `_`, spaces, or `.` 
and instead should be one word or be separated by `-`. 
An error may not necessarily occur if you don't follow this rule,
but there can be unintended side effects that you may not realize
and R will likely not tell you about it,
probably causing you quite a bit of annoyance and frustration.

[chunk labels]: https://yihui.name/knitr/options/#chunk-options

A nifty thing about using chunk labels is that you can see the name
when using "Document Outline" 
(found using "Ctrl+Shift+O"), 
but only if you have the option set in the 
"Tools -> Global Options -> R Markdown -> Show in document outline".

The name `setup` is also a special name for R Markdown.
When you run other code chunks in the document,
if the document was just opened up,
R Markdown will first run the code in the `setup` chunk.
This is a good place to put your `library()` calls.
Let's add tidyverse and NHANES to the chunk:

````markdown
`r ''````{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(NHANES)
`r ''````
````

Let's add another code chunk,
and this time simply put `NHANES` in it:

````markdown
`r ''````{r}
NHANES
`r ''````
````

You can run this code normally, with the cursor over the code 
and typing "Ctrl+Enter".
Or we can knit ("Ctrl+Shift+K") the document and see what it looks like.
When the HTML document opens,
you should see some text below the `setup` chunk that might look something like this:

```
Registered S3 methods overwritten by 'dbplyr':
  method         from
  print.tbl_lazy     
  print.tbl_sql      
── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.0 ──
✓ ggplot2 3.3.2          ✓ purrr   0.3.4     
✓ tibble  3.0.1          ✓ dplyr   1.0.0.9000
✓ tidyr   1.1.0          ✓ stringr 1.4.0     
✓ readr   1.3.1          ✓ forcats 0.5.0     
```

You probably don't want this text in your generated document.
You can change how code chunks work by using [chunk options].
They are available either by clicking on the gear in the top right corner of the chunk
(shown in Figure \@ref(fig:image-rstudio-code-chunk-gear))
or by typing in the area after the chunk label section.

[chunk options]: https://yihui.org/knitr/options/

```{r image-rstudio-code-chunk-gear, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Changing the settings for the code chunk actions."}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images/rstudio-code-chunk-gear.png"))
```

So, if you want to run the code but not show those messages and warnings,
you can add the options `message=FALSE` and `warning=FALSE`:

````markdown
`r ''````{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(NHANES)
`r ''````
````

If you want to hide the code, the messages, the warnings, and the output,
but still run the code,
you use the option `include=FALSE`.

````markdown
`r ''````{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(NHANES)
`r ''````
````

Other common options are:

- `echo`: To show the code. The default value to show is `TRUE`, to hide is `FALSE`.
- `results`: To show the output results. The default is `'markup'`, to hide is `'hide'`.
- `eval`: To evaluate (to run) the R code in the chunk. 
The default value is `TRUE` and `FALSE` does not run the code.

These options all work on the individual code chunk.
*Note*, that all the chunk options *must* be on *one* line,
after the `{r` tag.
If you want to set an option to all the code chunks,
for instance to hide all the code but keep the output,
you use the function `knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)`.
We *won't* do this in this session, 
but here is what it looks like:

````markdown
`r ''````{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(NHANES)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
`r ''````
````

A common results output that is included in documents are tables.
So let's run some R code and get R Markdown to create one.
First, create a new code chunk and name it `mean-bmi-table`.
Then, let's copy the code from the Data Wrangling session,
from Section \@ref(pivot-sac),
and include the `pivot_wider()` continuation of the pipe.
To keep the output smaller, 
we'll only select `SurveyYr`, `Sex`, `BMI`, and `Age`.

````markdown
`r ''````{r mean-bmi-table}
NHANES %>%
    rename(Sex = Gender) %>%
    select(SurveyYr, Sex, BMI, Age) %>%
    pivot_longer(c(-SurveyYr, -Sex),
                 names_to = "Variables",
                 values_to = "Values") %>%
    group_by(SurveyYr, Sex, Variables) %>%
    summarize(MeanValues = mean(Values, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from = Variables, values_from = MeanValues)
`r ''````
````

```{r mean-bmi-pivoting, echo=FALSE}
NHANES %>%
    rename(Sex = Gender) %>%
    select(SurveyYr, Sex, BMI, Age) %>%
    pivot_longer(c(-SurveyYr, -Sex),
                 names_to = "Variables",
                 values_to = "Values") %>%
    group_by(SurveyYr, Sex, Variables) %>%
    summarize(MeanValues = mean(Values, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from = Variables, values_from = MeanValues)
```

This output is almost in a table format.
We have the columns that could be the table headers,
and we have rows that would be meaningful table rows too.
To convert it into a pretty table in the R Markdown HTML output document,
we use the `kable()` function from the knitr package.
Because we don't want to load all of the knitr functions,
we'll use `knitr::kable()` instead.

````markdown
`r ''````{r mean-bmi-table}
NHANES %>%
    rename(Sex = Gender) %>%
    select(SurveyYr, Sex, BMI, Age) %>%
    pivot_longer(c(-SurveyYr, -Sex),
                 names_to = "Variables",
                 values_to = "Values") %>%
    group_by(SurveyYr, Sex, Variables) %>%
    summarize(MeanValues = mean(Values, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from = Variables, values_from = MeanValues) %>% 
    knitr::kable(caption = "Table caption. Mean values of Age and BMI for each sex by survey year.")
`r ''````
````

```{r mean-bmi-table, echo=FALSE}
NHANES %>%
    rename(Sex = Gender) %>%
    select(SurveyYr, Sex, BMI, Age) %>%
    pivot_longer(c(-SurveyYr, -Sex),
                 names_to = "Variables",
                 values_to = "Values") %>%
    group_by(SurveyYr, Sex, Variables) %>%
    summarize(MeanValues = mean(Values, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from = Variables, values_from = MeanValues) %>% 
    knitr::kable(caption = "Table caption. Mean values of Age and BMI for each sex by survey year.")
```

Now, knit ("Ctrl+Shift+K") and view the output in the HTML document.
Pretty eh!

## Exercise: Creating a table using R code

Time: 10 min

1. In the `doc/another-one.Rmd`,
create a new code chunk and call it `setup`.
Include the `library()` functions to load tidyverse and NHANES.
1. Create another code chunk and call it `prettier-table`.
Copy the code from above that calculates the mean BMI and Age
and paste the code into the new chunk.
1. Using the function `round()` around the `mean()` function,
round the values to 1 digit.
1. Rename `SurveyYr` to `Year` by using `rename()` after the `pivot_wider()`.
1. After the `rename()` function,
use `mutate()` to modify the `Sex` column so that male and female get capitalized.
Use `str_to_sentence(Sex)` to capitalize the first letter of the word.
1. Inside the previous `mutate()` function, modify the `Year` column to
replace the `_` with `-` by using `str_replace(Year, "_", "-")`.
1. Run the code chunk to make sure the code works, then knit the document. 
Don't forget about including the `knitr::kable()` function at the end of the pipe.

## Formatting text with Markdown syntax

Formatting text in Markdown is done using characters that are considered "special"
and act like commands.
So these special characters indicate what text is bolded,
what is a header, what is a list, and so on.
Almost every feature you need to write a scientific document is available in Markdown,
though not all.
If you can't get Markdown to do what you want,
my suggestion would be to try to fit your writing around Markdown, 
rather than force or fight with Markdown to do something it wasn't designed to do. 
You might actually find that the simpler Markdown approach is easier 
than what you wanted or were thinking of doing,
and that you can actually do quite a lot Markdown's capabilities.

### Headers 

Creating headers (like chapters or sections) is done by using one 
or more `#` at the beginning of a line 
and should always be preceded and followed by an empty line: 

```markdown
# Header 1

Paragraph.

## Header 2

Paragraph.

### Header 3

Paragraph.
```

### General text formatting

- `**bold**` gives **bold**. 
- `*italics*` gives *italics*.
- `super^script^` gives super^script^.
- `sub~script~` gives sub~script~.

### Lists

Lists are created by adding either `- ` or `1.` to the beginning of a line
and an empty line must be at the start and end of the list.

For unnumbered lists, it looks like:

```markdown
- item 1
- item 2
- item 3
```

which gives...

- item 1
- item 2
- item 3

And numbered lists look like:

```markdown
1. item 1
2. item 2
3. item 3
```

which gives...

1. item 1
2. item 2
3. item 3

### Block quotes

Block quotes are used when you want to emphasize a block of text,
usually for quoting someone. 
You create a block quote by putting a `>` at the beginning of the line,
and as with the lists and headers, 
needs empty lines before and after the text.
So it looks like:

```markdown
> Block quote 
```

which gives...

> Block quote 

### Adding footnotes

Footnotes are added by enclosing a number or word in square brackets (`[]`)
and beginning with an uptick (`^`). It looks like:

```markdown
Footnote[^1] or this[^note].

[^1]: Footnote content
[^note]: Another footnote
```

which gives...

Footnote[^1] or this[^note].

[^1]: Footnote content
[^note]: Another footnote

### Adding links to websites

Including a link to a website in your document is done by surrounding the link text
with square brackets (`[]`) followed by the link URL in brackets (`()`).
There must not be any space between the square brackets 
and the regular brackets (it should look like `[]()`).

```markdown
[Link](https://google.com)
```

which gives...

[Link](https://google.com)

### Inserting (simple) tables

While you can insert tables using Markdown too, 
it isn't recommended to do that for complicated or large tables.
Tables are created by separating columns with `|`,
with the table header being separated by a line that looks like `|:--|`.
A simple example is:

```
|   | Fun | Serious |
|:--|----:|--------:|
| **Happy** | 1234 | 5678 |
| **Sad** | 123 | 456 |
```

which gives...

|   | Fun | Serious |
|:--|:---:|:-------:|
| **Happy** | 1234 | 5678 |
| **Sad** | 123 | 456 |

The `|---:|` or `|:---|` tell the table to left-align or right-align the values
in the column. Center-align is `|:----:|`.

So you can probably imagine,
doing this for larger or even slightly more complicated tables is not practical.
A good alternative approach is to create the table in a spreadsheet,
importing that table into R within a code chunk,
and using `knitr::kable()` to create the table after that.

### Inline R code

R Markdown also allows you to including numbers 
(or other output) directly into a paragraph.
For instance, if you want to add a mean into some text,
it would look like:

> The mean of BMI is &#96;r round(mean(NHANES$BMI, na.rm = TRUE), 2)&#96;.

which gives...

The mean of BMI is `r round(mean(NHANES$BMI, na.rm = TRUE), 2)`.

But note that using inline R code can *only* insert a *single* number 
or character value, nothing more.

## Exercise: Practice using Markdown for writing text

Time: 8 min

1. Create three level 1 headers (`#`), called "Intro", "Methods and Results", "Discussion".
1. Create a level 2 header (`##`) under "Methods and Results" called "Analysis".
1. Write one random short sentence under each header. 
Bold (`**word**`) one word in each and italicize (`*word*`) another.
1. Include an inline R code to calculate 10 divided by 2 in the "Analysis" section.
1. Play around with adding some lists, tables, or anything else.

## Inserting figures, as files or from R code

Aside from tables,
figures are the other most common form of output inserted into documents.
And like tables, you can insert figures into the document 
either with Markdown or with R code chunks.
Let's first try doing it with Markdown.
First, we need an image to use.
Open a browser and search for a picture to use
(we're using a kitten, because they're cute).
Download the image, create a folder in `doc/` called `images`,
and save the image in that folder.
Then in your R Markdown document,
use the Markdown syntax for images: `![Caption text](path/to/image.png)`.
The image can be png, jpeg, or pdf.
If you download an image and intend to use it in an official document,
you will need to add text on the source and author of the image.

```markdown
![Image by Dimitri Houtteman from Pixabay.](doc/images/kitten.jpg)
```

Which gives...

![Image by <a href="https://pixabay.com/users/Dimhou-5987327/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=2536662">Dimitri Houtteman</a> from <a href="https://pixabay.com/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=2536662">Pixabay</a>](images/kitten.jpg)


You can also directly include a link to a picture instead of downloading the image,
though this may only work in HTML documents
and only if you have internet access.

Markdown syntax to control the image is limited.
If you want to change the size of the image,
it can be difficult. 
However, using R code chunks can simplify this!

First, let's create a new code chunk ("Ctrl+Alt+I"),
name the code chunk `kitten-image`,
and add the function `knitr::include_graphics()`.
To make it easier to find the image, 
use `here::here()` to point to the picture.
It should look like this:

````markdown
`r ''````{r kitten-image}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("doc/images/kitten.jpg"))
`r ''````
````

```{r kitten-image, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images/kitten.jpg"))
```

Knit the document again ("Ctrl+Shift+K") 
and view the HTML document with the new picture.
Now, let's change the width and height of the image,
along with adding a figure caption.
We do this with these code chunk options:

- `fig.cap`: For writing the figure caption.
- `out.width` and `out.height`: Sets the image width 
and height for external images (not created by R).
Can use percent to set the size, e.g. `"75%"`.

Change the width and height to `"50%"`,
along with adding a caption like `"Kittens attacking flowers!"`:

````markdown
`r ''````{r kitten-image, out.width="50%", out.height="50%", fig.cap="Kittens attacking flowers!"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images/kitten.jpg"))
`r ''````
````

```{r kitten-image-small, out.width="50%", out.height="50%", fig.cap="Kittens attacking flowers!", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images/kitten.jpg"))
```

Knit again to see how the image changed.
Great! But the real fun comes by inserting figures directly from R code.
Let's create another code chunk ("Ctrl+Alt+I")
and name the code chunk `exploring-plot`.
We'll copy and paste the visualization code we used in Section \@ref(visualization)
into the code chunk.
You can copy and paste this code as well:

````markdown
`r ''````{r exploring-plot}
nhanes_tidied <- NHANES %>% 
    rename(Sex = Gender) %>% 
    filter(!is.na(Diabetes))
nhanes_tidied %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = BMI, y = BPSysAve, colour = Age)) +
    geom_point() +
    facet_grid(cols = vars(Diabetes),
               rows = vars(Sex)) +
    scale_color_viridis_c() +
    theme_minimal()
`r ''````
````

```{r exploring-plot}
nhanes_tidied <- NHANES %>% 
    rename(Sex = Gender) %>% 
    filter(!is.na(Diabetes))
nhanes_tidied %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = BMI, y = BPSysAve, colour = Age)) +
    geom_point() +
    facet_grid(cols = vars(Diabetes),
               rows = vars(Sex)) +
    scale_color_viridis_c() +
    theme_minimal()
```

Run the code in the code chunk to make sure it runs properly,
by typing "Ctrl+Enter" 
(or "Ctrl+Shift+Enter" to run all the code in the code chunk at once).
Once it creates the figure below the code chunk,
knit the document again to see how the figure gets inserted into the HTML document.

You might also notice that you get a warning below the code chunk too.
Let's get rid of that warning message,
make the figure bigger, and add a caption.
When you create a figure with R code, 
you need to use different options instead of `out.width` and `out.height`:

- `fig.width` and `fig.height`: Sets the width 
and height of the figure, where the default value is 7.

Add the chunk options `fig.width`, `fig.height`, and `fig.cap`, 
along with the `warning=FALSE` to the code chunk.

````markdown
`r ''````{r exploring-plot, fig.width=9, fig.height=8, fig.cap="Exploratory figure of the NHANES dataset", warning=FALSE}
nhanes_tidied <- NHANES %>% 
    rename(Sex = Gender) %>% 
    filter(!is.na(Diabetes))
nhanes_tidied %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = BMI, y = BPSysAve, colour = Age)) +
    geom_point() +
    facet_grid(cols = vars(Diabetes),
               rows = vars(Sex)) +
    scale_color_viridis_c() +
    theme_minimal()
`r ''````
````

```{r exploring-plot-bigger, fig.width=9, fig.height=8, fig.cap="Exploratory figure of the NHANES dataset", warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
nhanes_tidied <- NHANES %>% 
    rename(Sex = Gender) %>% 
    filter(!is.na(Diabetes))
nhanes_tidied %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = BMI, y = BPSysAve, colour = Age)) +
    geom_point() +
    facet_grid(cols = vars(Diabetes),
               rows = vars(Sex)) +
    scale_color_viridis_c() +
    theme_minimal()
```

Knit the document again
and view the generated HTML document.
Cool! You've just made an easily reproducible figure in a document!

## Other R Markdown features

**Take 5 min to read these sections below before proceeding to the final exercise**.

### Making your report prettier

For HTML documents, customizing the appearance (e.g. fonts) is pretty easy,
since settings to change the theme can be used directly in the YAML header.
For instance, there's a setting within `html_document` called `theme`.
It would look like this:

```yaml
---
title: "My report"
output:
    html_document:
        theme: sandstone
---
```

Notice the indentations. 
Indentation tells YAML what key is related to another key,
i.e. if it is a sub-key.
The key `theme` is a sub-key (an option) of `html_document`,
which is a sub-key (an option) of `output`.
Check out the R Markdown [documentation] to see other themes you can use.
The themes are all [Bootswatch] themes,
with most of them being available for use in HTML documents.

[Bootswatch]: https://bootswatch.com/3/

Modifying the theme and appearance of Word documents,
on the other hand, is much more difficult.
Since Word can't easily be programmatically modified like HTML can,
changing the appearance of the document itself requires 
that you manually create a Word template file first,
manually modify the appearance,
and then link to that template file with the `reference_docx` 
option in the YAML header (as a sub-key of `word_document`).
More detail on this can be found in the [documentation](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/word-document.html).

### Collaborating on R Markdown documents

There are multiple ways in general of collaborating on a document:

1. One person has the primary task of writing up the report 
and then gets feedback from other collaborators through the use of
"Track Changes" or by inserting comments in Word.
2. Multiple people are responsible for writing the report
and probably use different documents that they will end up merging later on.
Or they email back and forth 
(or use something like Dropbox or shared folders)
and work on a single document.

The first workflow is not possible in an R Markdown document.
Instead, you'd use a workflow that probably resembles how peer reviews are done,
i.e. reading the document
and making comments in a separate file to upload to the journal later.
Or you'd use a workflow that revolves around GitHub and Git,
an efficient workflow that has been tried 
and tested by tens of thousands of teams in tens of hundreds of companies globally.
The goal of this course is to slowly move researchers more into the modern era,
based on modern technology, tools, and workflows.

The second workflow is pretty similar.
You might split up a document into sections that each collaborator may work on,
and then later on merge them together.
This last approach is what we will get you to do for the group project.

## Final exercise: Group work

Time: 30 min

It's now time to start putting things together as a report 
and to present on it later in the afternoon.

- As a team, 
complete item 7 and its sub-tasks in the [group assignment](assignment.html)
(to jump quickly to the assignment, 
run `r3::open_assignment()` in the RStudio Console).
- Distribute the tasks so each team member is (mostly) doing something different.
    - Create one R Markdown file for each team member,
    and each person works on their own file.
    Later this file will be merged into the final report.
- Frequently use the "Git workflow": 
Add to staging, commit, push, and pull the changes you've made.
    - You'll likely deal with merge conflicts, 
    which is a good chance to practice with Git more.
- Try to "knit" your document to HTML often, 
to make sure the analysis is reproducible.
    - **Note**: For now, *do not* add and commit the HTML report.

Once you as a team are happy with the report, figures, and tables,
make sure that everyone does a final add-commit-push to your GitHub repository.
Then, designate someone to pull from GitHub, 
merge each R Markdown file into a single `report.Rmd` file in the `doc/` folder,
and knit the `.Rmd` document to make sure it knits correctly. 
Then add-commit-push the HTML report to GitHub.
You should now be ready to present your report!
