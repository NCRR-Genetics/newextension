> When in RStudio, quickly jump to this page using `r3::open_proj_management()`.

**Session objectives**:

1. Create self-contained projects that allow for easier reproducibility
1. Use built-in tools in RStudio to make it easier to manage R projects
1. Become familiar with the very basics of R
1. Apply tools to use a consistent "grammar" and "styling" when writing R code 
and making files
1. Know of and use different approaches to getting and finding help

## What is a project and why use it?

Before we create a project, we should first define what we mean by "project".
What is a project? In this case, a project is a set of files that together
lead to some type of scientific "output" (for instance a manuscript).
Use data for your output? That's part of the project. 
Do any analysis on the data to give some results? Also part of the project.
Write a document, e.g. a manuscript, based on the data and results? 
Have figures inserted into the output document? 
These are also part of the project.

More and more *how we make a claim* in a scientific product is just as important
as the output describing the claim. 
This includes not only the written description of the methods 
but also the exact steps taken, i.e. the code used.
So, using a project setup can help with keeping things self-contained
and easier to track and link with the scientific output. 
Here is some things to consider when doing projects:

- Organise all R scripts and files in the same folder (also called "directory")
so it is more "self-contained"
- Use a common and consistent folder and file structure for your projects
- Use [version control] (to track changes to files)
- Make raw data "read-only" (don't edit it directly) and use code to show what
was done.
- Whenever possible, use code to create output (figures, tables) rather than
manualling creating or editing them.
- Think of your code and project like you do with your manuscript or thesis:
that other people will eventually look at it and review it, 
that it will be published.

These simple steps can also be huge steps toward being reproducible in your analysis.
And by managing your projects in a reproducible fashion,
you'll not only make your science better and more rigorous, 
it also makes your life easier too! 

### RStudio and R Projects

RStudio is here to help us with that by using [R Projects]. 
RStudio projects make it straightforward to divide your work into multiple contexts, 
each with their own working directory, workspace, history, and source documents.

There are many ways one could organise a project folder. 
We'll be setting up a project folder and file structure using [prodigenr](http://prodigenr.lukewjohnston.com/index.html):

```{r prodigenr-setup, eval=FALSE}
prodigenr::setup_project("LearningR")
```

When we use the `::` colon here, we are saying:

> Hey R, from the prodigenr package use the setup_project function.

This function will then create the following folders and files:

```
LearningR
├── R
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── fetch_data.R
│   └── setup.R
├── data
│   └── README.md
├── doc
│   └── README.md
├── .Rbuildignore
├── .gitignore
├── DESCRIPTION
├── learning-r.Rproj
└── README.md
```

This forces a specific, and consistent, folder structure to all your work. Think 
of this like the "introduction", "methods", "results", and "discussion" sections 
of your paper. Each project is then like a single manuscript or report, that
contains everything relevant to that specific project. There is a lot of
power in something as simple as a consistent structure. Projects are used to
make life easier. Once a project is opened within RStudio the following actions
are taken:

- A new R session (process) is started.
- The current working directory is set to the project directory.
- RStudio project options are loaded.

The README in each folder explains a bit about what should be placed there. But
briefly:

1. Documents like manuscripts, abstracts, and exploration type documents should 
be put in the `doc/` directory (including [R Markdown] files which we will cover
[later](reproducible-documents)).
1. Data, raw data, and metadata should be in either the `data/` directory or
in `data-raw/` for the raw data.
1. All R files and code should be in the `R/` directory.
1. Name all new files to reflect their content or function. Follow the tidyverse 
[style guide for file naming](https://style.tidyverse.org/files.html).

[R Markdown]: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/

For this course, we'll delete the files `fetch_data.R` and `setup.R` in the `R/` folder,
as well as the `.Rbuildignore` file. 
For any project, it is **highly recommended** to use [version control],
which we'll cover in more detail [later](version-control).

### Exercise: Reading the READMEs

Time: 5 min

1. Briefly read through each of the `README.md` files by opening them up in RStudio.

### Exercise: Better file naming

Time: 4 min

Let's take some time to think about file naming. Look at the list of file names
below. Which file names are good names and which shouldn't you use? We'll
discuss afterwards why some are good names and others are not.

```
fit models.R
fit-models.R
foo.r
stuff.r
get_data.R
Manuscript version 10.docx
manuscript.docx
new version of analysis.R
trying.something.here.R
plotting-regression.R
utility_functions.R
code.R
```

### Next steps after creating the project

Now that we've created a project and associated folders, let's add some more
options to the project. One option to set is to ensure that every R session you 
start with is a "blank slate", by typing and running in the Console:

```{r blank-slate, eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_blank_slate()
```

Now, let's add some R scripts that we will use in later sessions of the course.

```{r add-r-files, eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_r("project-session")
usethis::use_r("wrangling-session")
usethis::use_r("version-control-session")
usethis::use_r("visualization-session")
```

As you may tell, the usethis package can be quite handy.

## Writing code in RStudio

### RStudio layout and usage

Open up the `R/project-session.R` file and type out the code in that file for 
the code-along parts. 
You've already gotten a bit familiar with RStudio in the pre-course tasks,
but if you want more details, RStudio has a great 
[cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/#ide) on how to use RStudio.
The items to know right now are the "Console", "Files"/"Help", and "Source"
tabs.

Code is written in the "Source" tab, where it saves the code and text as a file.
You send code to the console from the opened file by typing `Ctrl-Enter` (or
clicking the "Run"). 
In the "Source" tab (where R scripts and R Markdown files are shown), 
there is a "Document Outline" button (top right beside the "Run" button) 
that shows you the headers or "Sections" (more on that later). 
Click it to enable the outline from now on.

### Basics of using R

In R, everything is an object and every action is a function. A function is an
object, but an object isn't always a function. To create an object, also called
a variable, we use the `<-` assignment operator:

```{r using-assignment-operator}
weight_kilos <- 100
weight_kilos
```

The new object now stores the value we assigned it. We can read it like:

> - "weight kilos now contains the number 100", or
> - "put 100 into the object weight kilos"

You can name an object in R almost anything you want, but it's best to stick to
a [style guide]. For instance, use `snake_case` to name things.

There are also several main "classes" (or types) of objects in R: lists,
vectors, matrices, and data.frames. For now, the only two we will cover are
*vectors* and *data.frames*. Vectors are a string of values put together while
data.frames are multiple vectors put together as columns.

```{r vectors-dataframes, eval=FALSE}
# These are vectors:
# Character vector
c("a", "b", "c")
# Logic vector
c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
# Numeric vector
c(1, 5, 6)

# This is a dataframe:
head(iris)
```

Notice how we use the `#` to write comments or notes. Whatever we write after
the "hash" (`#`) means that R will ignore it and not run it. The function `c()`
combines values together and `head()` prints the first 6 rows. To get more
information from data.frames, use:

```{r examining-dataframes}
# Column names
colnames(iris)
# Structure
str(iris)
# Summary statistics
summary(iris)
```

### Using auto-completion in RStudio

To type out objects in R faster, use "Tab-completion" to finish a object name for you.
As you type out a command, hit the TAB key to see a list of objects available.
RStudio will not only list out the objects,
but also shows the possible options and help associated with the object.

Try it out. In the RStudio Console, start typing:

```r
col
```

Then hit TAB. You should see a list of functions to use. 
Hit TAB again to finish with `colnames()`. 
This simple tool can save so much time and can prevent spelling mistakes.

### R object naming practices

If you've ever seen some old R code,
you may notice that functions and objects are usually short.
For instance, `str()` is the function to see the `object_structure()`.
Back then, there were no tab-completion tools, 
so typing out long names was painful. 
Now we have powerful auto-completion tools.
So this also means that you should write out descriptive names instead of short ones.
For instance, in the past, the object `weight_kilo` would have been named something like `x`.
But this doesn't tell us what that is and doesn't help us write better code.

The ability to read, understand, modify, and write simple pieces of code is an
essential skill for modern data analysis tasks and projects.
So! Here's some tips for writing R code:

- *Be descriptive* with your names!
- As with natural languages like English, write as if someone will read your code.
- Stick to a *[style guide]*.
- Use Sections (`"Code->Insert Section"` or `Ctrl-Shift-R`) to separate content in
scripts (like headers in documents).


Even though R doesn't care about naming, spacing, and indenting, it really
matters how your code looks. Coding is just like writing. Even though you may go
through a brainstorming note-taking stage of writing, you eventually need to
write correctly so others can understand, *and read*, what you are trying to
say. In coding, brainstorming is fine, but eventually you need to code in a
readable way. That's why using a [style guide] is really important.

### Exercise: Make code more readable

Time: 15 min

Briefly scan through the [style guide] in the link.
Then try to make the below code more readable. 
Copy and paste these text into the `R/project-session.R` file.
**NOTE**: *Don't* run these code, just edit them to be better named.
There are some tricks in here that we haven't covered yet,
but will when we go through the exercise.

The code below is in some way either *wrong* or incorrectly written. Edit the
code so it follows the correct style and so it's easier to understand and read.
You don't need to understand what the code does, just follow the guide.

```{r ex-wrong-code-naming, eval=FALSE}
# Object names
DayOne
dayone
T <- FALSE
c <- 9

# Spacing
x[,1]
x[ ,1]
x[ , 1]
mean (x, na.rm = TRUE)
mean( x, na.rm = TRUE )
height<-feet*12+inches
mean(x, na.rm=10)
sqrt(x ^ 2 + y ^ 2)
df $ z
x <- 1 : 10

# Indenting
if (y < 0 && debug)
message("Y is negative")
```

<details><summary><strong>Click for a possible solution</strong></summary>
<p>

The old code is in comments and the better code is below it.

```{r ex-wrong-code-naming-answer, eval=FALSE}
# Object names

# Should be camel case
# DayOne
day_one
# dayone
day_one

# Should not over write existing function names
# T = TRUE, so don't name anything T
# T <- FALSE
false <- FALSE
# c is a function name already. Plus c is not descriptive
# c <- 9
number_value <- 9

# Spacing
# Commas should be in correct place
# x[,1]
# x[ ,1]
# x[ , 1]
x[, 1]
# Spaces should be in correct place
# mean (x, na.rm = TRUE)
# mean( x, na.rm = TRUE )
mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)
# height<-feet*12+inches
height <- feet * 12 + inches
# mean(x, na.rm=10)
mean(x, na.rm = 10)
# sqrt(x ^ 2 + y ^ 2)
sqrt(x^2 + y^2)
# df $ z
df$z
# x <- 1 : 10
x <- 1:10

# Indenting should be done after if, for, else functions
# if (y < 0 && debug)
# message("Y is negative")
if (y < 0 && debug) {
    message("Y is negative")
}
```

</p>
</details>

### Automatic styling in RStudio

You may have organised the exercise by hand, 
however it is possible to do it automatically. 
RStudio has an automatic styling tool, 
found in the menu item `"Code -> Reformat Code"` (or with `Ctrl-Shift-A`). 
Let's try out this styling by copy and pasting the exercise code again
and running the reformatting on it. Cool eh?

The tidyverse [style guide] also has package called 
[styler](http://styler.r-lib.org/) that automates fixing code to fit the style guide.
With styler you can fix styling on multiple files at once.
We won't cover styler, so this is more as a future tool to try out.

### Packages, data, and file paths

A major strength of R is in its ability for others to easily create packages
that simplify doing complex tasks (e.g. running mixed effects models with the
lme4 package or creating figures with the ggplot2 package) and for anyone to 
easily install and use that package. So make use of packages!

You load a package by writing:

```{r loading-packages, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

Working with multiple R scripts and files, it quickly gets tedious to always
write out each library function at the top of each script. 
One better way of managing this is by creating a new file 
and keeping all package loading code in that file.
Then, in other files, source the package loading file in each R script. So:

```{r create-package-loading-script, eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_r("package-loading")
```

In the `package-loading.R` file:

```{r add-tidyverse-package-loading, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

In the `proj-management.R` file, put this at the top of the file.

```{r sourcing-top-of-file, eval=FALSE}
source(here::here("R/package-loading.R"))
```

There's a new thing `here`! The [here] package uses a function called `here()` 
that makes it easier to manage file paths. What is a file path and why is this 
necessary? A file path is the list of folders a file is found in. For instance,
your CV may be found in `/Users/Documents/personal_things/CV.docx`. The problem 
with file paths in R is that when you run a script interactively (e.g. what we
do in class and normally), 
the file path and "working directory" is located at the Project level 
(where the `.Rproj` file is found).
You can see the working directory by looking at the top of the RStudio Console.

But! When you `source()` an R script, it may likely run *in the
folder it is saved in*, e.g. in the `R/` folder. So your file path
`R/packages-loading.R` won't work because there isn't a folder called R in the
`R/` folder. Often people use the function `setwd()`, but this is *never* a good
idea since using it makes your script *runnable only on your computer*... which
makes it no longer reproducible. We use the `here()` function to tell R to go
to the project root (where the `.Rproj` file is found) and then use that file
path. This simple function can make your work more reproducible and easier for
you to use later on.

### Encountering problems and finding help

You **will** encounter problems and issues and errors when working with R... 
and you will encounter then **all the time**. This is a fact of life. How you 
deal with the warnings and errors is the important part. Here are some steps:

1. *First*, try to stay calm, problems happen to *everyone*, 
no matter their skill level. You *can fix it*! `r emo::ji("smile")`
1. Go over the code again and check for any mistakes:
    - Any missing commas?
    - Any missing end brackets like `]`, `)`, or `}`?
    - Is the object name spelled correctly?
1. Go back in the code a bit and run each one at a time to see where the problem occurs.
1. Restart the R session (`"Session -> Restart R"` or `Ctrl-Shift-F10`) 
and run the code from beginning again, tracking what objects get created and if
the proper object name is used later on.
1. (Rarely need to do) Close and re-open RStudio and try again.

If these don't work, try to find help by:

- Using `?` to get help on a function. When you run this function on an object,
it will open up the help in the "Help" tab of RStudio. Try it out:

    ```{r using-help, eval=FALSE}
    ?colnames
    ```

- Check out the [RStudio cheatsheets], which are printable PDF files that are 
great sources of help and learning.
- If the problem relates to a specific package, check out its website. 
The [tidyverse] packages all have amazing documentation that you can use to help
you with problems you may have.
- Check [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r), 
which is a coding-related question and answer website.
- Google it[^nojoke]. No joke, 
those who are "more expert" in coding languages like R are skilled mostly
*because they know how to ask Google the right questions*.

## Summary of session

- Use R Projects in RStudio (e.g. with prodigenr)
- Use a standard folder and file structure
- Use a consistent [style guide] for code and files
- Keep R scripts simple, focused, short
- Use the `here()` function from the [here] package
- Use Tab auto-completion when writing code
- Use `?` to get help on an R object

## Final exercise: Group work

Time: 15 min.

For each member of the group:

- Complete item 1. of the [group assignment](assignment)
(to jump quickly to the assignment, 
run `r3::open_assignment()` in the RStudio Console).
    - Name the project based on your group name.
    - While everyone will create a new project, assign one person as the "coordinator".
    In the [Version Control](version-control) session, 
    this person will use their project folder as the base for the initial tasks 
    of the final exercise.
- Open up the `README.md` file and write a few sentences about yourself.
- Run these functions from the usethis package to setup the project 
and to create these files:

    ```r
    usethis::use_blank_slate()
    usethis::use_data_raw("original-data")
    usethis::use_r("generate-figures")
    ```
