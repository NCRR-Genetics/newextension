jitter plots, and (appropriate) barplots

## Basic principles for creating graphs

**Please take ~10 min to read through this section, as well as the next one**.

Making graphs in R is surprisingly easy and can be done with very little code.
Because of the ease with which to make them,
this gives you time to reason about *why* you are making them,
if the graph is the *most appropriate* for the data or results,
and how you can design your graphs to be as accessible 
and understandable as possible.

To start, here are some tips for making a graph 
(there are excellent online books on this that are included in the 
[resources](resources) chapter:

- Whenever possible or reasonable, show raw data values rather than summaries 
(e.g. means)
- Though commonly used in scientific papers, 
*[avoid barplots]* with means and error bars as they greatly misrepresent the data
(we'll cover why later)
- Maximise Data-Ink ratio by reducing non-essential or non-data text and features on your graph
- Use colour to 1) highlight and enhance your message 
and 2) to make the plot visually appealing
- Use a colour-blind friendly palette so the plot is more accessible to others
(more on this later)

## Basic structure of using ggplot2

ggplot2 is an implementation of the ["Grammar of Graphics"](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387245447) (gg). 
This is a powerful approach to creating plots 
because it provides a set of structured rules (a "grammar") 
that allow you to expressively describe components (or "layers") of a graph.
Because you are able to describe the components,
it makes it easier to then implement those "descriptions" into creating a graph.
There are at least four aspects to using ggplot2 that relate to its "grammar":

- Aesthetics, `aes()`: How data are mapped to the plot, for instance, what
data to put on the x axis, on the y axis, 
and/or whether to use a colour for a variable.
- Geometries, `geom_` functions: The visual representation of the data, as a
layer. This tells ggplot2 how the aesthetics should be visualized.
For instance, should they be shown as points, lines, boxes, bins, or bars?
- Scales, `scale_` functions: These control the visual properties of the `geom_` layers.
For instance, to modify the appearance of the axes, to change the colour of dots from red to blue,
or to use a different colour palette entirely.
- Themes, `theme_` functions or `theme()`: 
Directly controls all other aspects of the plot.
For instance, control the size, font, and angle of axis text. 
Or maybe change the thickness or colour of the axis lines.

There is a massive amount of features in ggplot2.
Thankfully, ggplot2 was specifically designed to make it easy to find 
and use its functions and settings using tab auto-completion.
As an example, if you type out `geom_` and then hit tab, 
you will get a list of all the geoms available.
Likewise with `scale_` and all the options inside `theme()`
(e.g. type out `theme(axis.` and then hit tab, 
and a list of theme settings related to the axis will pop up).
ggplot2 also works best with tidy data and with data in the long format.

So, why do we teach ggplot2 and not base R plotting?
Base R plotting functionality is quite good and you can make really nice,
publication-quality graphs.
However, there are several major limitations to base R plots from a beginner
and a user-interface perspective: 

- Function and argument naming and documentation are inconsistent 
and opaque (e.g. the `cex` argument, in *certain but not all functions*, 
magnifies text and symbols, 
but you can't tell from the name that it does that)
- User-friendly documentation that is accessible to a broad range of people
is not much of a priority, 
so often the help documentation isn't written with beginners in mind
- Graphs are built similar to painting on a canvas:
Make a mistake and you need to start all over (e.g. restart R)

These limitations are due to the fact that base R plotting was developed:

- By different people over different periods of time
- By people who were/are mostly in statistics and maths
- By people who (generally) don't have training in principles of
software user-design, user-interface, or engineering
- Without a strong "design philosophy" to guide development
- During a time when auto-completion didn't really exist or was sub-optimal,
so short function and object names were more important than they are today

On the other hand, ggplot2:

- Has excellent documentation for help and learning
- Has a strong design philosophy that makes it easier to use
- Works in "layers", so you don't have to start over if you make a mistake
- Works very well with auto-completion
- Function and argument naming is consistent and *descriptive* (in plain English)

These are the reasons we teach and use ggplot2. 
Let's make our first graphs together now.

## Graph individual variables

Very often you want to get a sense of your data, 
one variable (i.e. one column in a data frame) at a time.
You create these plots to see the distribution of a variable
and visually inspect the data for any problems.
There are several ways of plotting continuous variables 
(e.g. weight, height) in ggplot2. 
For discrete variables (e.g. "male" and "female"), 
there is really only one way. 

You may notice that since the [data wrangling chapter](wrangling),
we used the word "column" to describe the columns in the data frame,
but now we're saying "variable".
There's a reason for this: ggplot2 really only works with tidy data.
And if we recall from the definition of tidy data,
it is made up of "variables" (columns) and "observations" (rows) of a data frame.
To us, a "variable" is something that we are interested in analyzing or visualizing, 
and that contains only values relevant to that measurement
(e.g. a `Weight` variable must only contain values for weight).
The NHANES dataset is already pretty tidy:
Rows are participants at the survey year,
columns are the variables that were measured.
So, from now on, we call them "variables".

Ok, let's visually explore our data. 
Open the previously used R Project, and create a new R Markdown file called `visualization-session.Rmd`. (To do this, go to “File -> New File -> R Markdown”, and a dialog box will then pop up. Type in “Data visualization” in the title section and your name in the author section. Choose HTML as the output format. Delete unneeded text and codechunks, then save this file as `visualization-session.Rmd` in the doc/ folder).
This script we will use for the code-along and exercises in data visualization.

First, we want to load packages, so let's write that at the top of the file, right under the YAML header.

`Load packages`

Then add a new code chunk with the shortcut “Ctrl+Alt+I” or by using the menu item “Code -> Insert Chunk”
Then add this to the first code chunk:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
source(here::here("R/package-loading.R"))
```

Now we are ready to start creating the first plot! 
Since BMI is a strong risk factor for diabetes, let's check out its distribution.
To show distributions, there are two good geoms: 
`geom_density()` and `geom_histogram()`.
Type in an appropriate heading and add a new code chunk, then type:

```{r, message=FALSE}
# First, load the small, tidied dataset from the wrangling session
load(here::here("data/nhanes_small.rda"))

# Create density plot for BMI
ggplot(nhanes_small, aes(x = BMI)) +
    geom_density()

# Create histogram for BMI
ggplot(nhanes_small, aes(x = BMI)) +
    geom_histogram()
```

It's good practice to always create a new line after the `+`.
We can see that for the most part there is a good distribution with BMI,
though there are several values that are quite large...
some at 80 BMI units!

The plots above are for continuous variables, 
but what about for discrete?
Well, sadly, there's really only one: `geom_bar()`.
This isn't a geom for a barplot though! 
This shows the counts of a discrete variable.
There are many discrete variables in NHANES, including sex and diabetes, 
so let's visualize those. 

```{r}
# create count barplot for sex
ggplot(nhanes_small, aes(x = Sex)) +
    geom_bar()
```
We can see that there are almost equal numbers of females and males.

Now to create a count bar plot for diabetes status:

```{r}
# create count barplot for diabetes status
ggplot(nhanes_small, aes(x = Diabetes)) +
    geom_bar()
```

For diabetes, it seems there is some missingness in the dataset.
Since diabetes status is an important variable for us,
let's remove all missing values right now and plot it again.

```{r remove-missing-diabetes}
# Remove individuals with missing diabetes status
nhanes_tidied <- nhanes_small %>% 
    filter(!is.na(Diabetes))

# Save the tidied dataset as an rda file in the data folder
usethis::use_data(nhanes_tidied, overwrite = TRUE)

# Create a new count barplot for diabetes status
ggplot(nhanes_tidied, aes(x = Diabetes)) +
    geom_bar()
```

Let's take a minute to talk about the commonly used barplots with mean and error bars.
In all cases, bar plots should only be used for discrete (categorical) data
where you want to show counts or proportions. They should as a general rule not be used for continuous data.
This is because the commonly used "bar plot of means with error bars" 
actually hides the underlying distribution of the data.
To have a better explanation of this,
you can read the article on why to [avoid barplots] after the course. 
The image below, taken from that paper, 
shows briefly why this plot type is not useful. 

(ref:deceptive-barplots) Bars deceive what the data actually look like. Image sourced from a [PLoS Biology article](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002128).

```{r barplots-deceive, fig.cap="(ref:deceptive-barplots)", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images/barplots-deceive.png"))
```

If you *do* want to create a barplot, 
you'll quickly find out that it actually is quite hard to do in ggplot2.
The reason it is difficult to create in ggplot2 is by design:
it's a bad plot to use, so use something else.

## Plotting two variables

Next section is about plotting two variables at a time.
There are many more types of "geoms" to use when plotting two variables.
Which one to choose depends on what you are trying to show
or to communicate, and what the data are. 
Usually the variable that you "control or influence" 
(the independent variable) in an experimental setting goes on the x-axis,
and the variable that "responds" (the dependent variable)
goes on the y-axis.

When you have *two continuous* variables, some geoms are:

- `geom_point()`, which is used to create a standard scatterplot
- `geom_hex()`, which is used to replace `geom_point()` 
when your data is *massive*, since creating points 
for each value in a large dataset can take a long time to plot
- `geom_smooth()`, which applies a "regression-type" line to the data
(default uses LOESS regression)

Let's check out how BMI may influence cholesterol using a basic scatterplot,
hex plot, and a smoothing line plot:

```{r, message=FALSE}
# Using 2 continuous 
bmi_chol <- ggplot(nhanes_tidied, aes(x = BMI, y = TotChol))
# Standard scatter plot
bmi_chol + 
    geom_point()
# Standard scatter plot, but with hexagons
bmi_chol + 
    geom_hex()
```    

Notice how the hex plot changes the colour of the data 
based on how many values are in the area of the plot.

```{r, message=FALSE}
# Runs a smoothing line with confidence interval
bmi_chol + 
    geom_smooth()
    
# Or combine two geoms, scatter plot with smoothing line
bmi_chol + 
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth()
```

### Two discrete variables

Sadly, for two discrete variables, 
there are not many options available without major data wrangling. 
The most useful geom for this is `geom_bar()` like before, 
but with an added variable.
Because `geom_bar()` has a "fill" (coloured inside), 
we can change that fill based on a variable.
So let's see what the difference in diabetes status is between sexes.

```{r}
# 2 categorical/discrete
# (We can pipe data into ggplot)
two_discrete <- nhanes_tidied %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = Diabetes, fill = Sex)) 

# Stacked
two_discrete + 
    geom_bar()
```

By default, `geom_bar()` will make fill groups stacked on top of each other.
For this case, it isn't really that useful.
So let's instead have them side by side. 
For that, we need to use the `position` argument with a function called
`position_dodge()`.
This new function takes the fill grouping variable and "dodges" them 
(moves them) to be side by side.

```{r}
# "dodged" (side-by-side) bar plot
two_discrete + 
    geom_bar(position = position_dodge())
```

Now you can see that there are slightly more men that have diabetes.

### Discrete and continuous variables

When the variable types are mixed (continuous and discrete),
there are many more geoms available to use.
A couple of good ones are:

- `geom_boxplot()`, which makes boxplots that show the median 
and a measure of range in the data. 
Boxplots are generally pretty good at showing the spread of data.
- `geom_jitter()`, which makes a type of "scatter" plot, 
but for discrete and continuous variables. 
A useful argument to `geom_jitter()` is called `width`,
which controls how wide the jittered points go out from the center line.
This plot is much better than the boxplot since it shows the *actual data*,
and not summaries like a boxplot does.
When you have lots of data points however, it isn't very good.
- `geom_violin()`, which shows a density distribution (like `geom_density()`).
This geom is great when there is a lot of data 
and `geom_jitter()` is just a mass of dots.

Let's see how BMI differs between those with or without diabetes.

```{r}
# Using mixed data
two_mixed <- nhanes_tidied %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = Diabetes, y = BMI))

# Standard boxplot with outliers
two_mixed + 
    geom_boxplot()
# Show the actual data using a jitter plot
two_mixed + 
    geom_jitter()
# Give more distance between groups
two_mixed + 
    geom_jitter(width = 0.2)
# Show the distribution with a voilin plot
two_mixed + 
    geom_violin()
```

The violin plot kind of looks like two stingrays, eh?

## Exercise: Create plots with one or two variables

Time: 15 min

Create an exercise script by typing in the Console `usethis::use_r("exercises-visualization")`.
Copy and paste the below code into that script.
Complete as many tasks as you can below.

1. vLike we did above, remove individuals that have missing diabetes status and rename the Gender column to Sex. Reminder, use ! to invert a logic condition (from TRUE to FALSE and vice versa, e.g. for keeping non-missing). We do this again in this script to make the script self-contained.
2. Using `geom_histogram()`, find out what the distribution is for the two variables below.
    a. `Age` (participant's age at collection)
    b. `DiabetesAge` (age of diabetes diagnosis)
3. Using `geom_bar()`, find out how many people have data recorded for each of these discrete variables.
What can you say about most people for these variables?
    a. `SmokeNow` (current smoking status)
    b. `PhysActive` (does moderate to vigorous physical activity)
4. Using `geom_hex()`, find out how BMI relates to the two blood pressure variables.
What is the most common BMI and blood pressure combination?
Do you notice anything about the data from the plots?
    a. `BPSysAve` (average systolic blood pressure)
    b. `BPDiaAve` (average diastolic blood pressure)
5. Using `geom_bar()`, find out how `PhysActive` those with or without `Diabetes` are.
Put `Diabetes` on the x-axis.
What can you say based on the data? 
Note the differences in missingness between groups.
Don't forget to use `position_dodge()` in the `position` argument, in order to arrange the bars side by side.
6. Using `geom_violin()`, 
find how `Poverty` levels are different for those with or without `Diabetes`.
Put `Diabetes` on the x-axis.
Looking at the distributions, 
what can you conclude about how poverty may be associated with diabetes status?
    - The `Poverty` variable is calculated as a ratio between income and a poverty threshold. 
    Smaller numbers mean higher poverty.

```{r exercise-2-var-plots, eval=FALSE}
# 1. Remove individuals with missing diabetes status, rename Gender to Sex
nhanes_tidy <- NHANES %>% 
    # Filter rows
    ___(___(___)) %>% 
    # Rename column
    ___(___ = ___)

# 2a. Distribution of Age
ggplot(___, aes(x = ___)) +
    ___()
    
# 2b. Distribution of DiabetesAge
ggplot(___, aes(x = ___)) +
    ___()

# 3a. Number of people who SmokeNow
ggplot(___, aes(x = ___)) +
    ___()

# 3a. Number of people who are PhysActive
ggplot(___, aes(x = ___)) +
    ___()

# 4a. BMI relation to systolic blood pressure
ggplot(___, aes(x = ___, y = ___)) +
    ___()

# 4b. BMI relation to diastolic blood pressure
ggplot(___, aes(x = ___, y = ___)) +
    ___()
    
# 5. Physically active people with or without diabetes
ggplot(___, aes(x = ___, fill = ___)) +
    ___(___ = ___())

# 6. Poverty levels between those with or without diabetes
ggplot(___, aes(x = ___, y = ___)) +
    ___()
```

```

## Visualizing three or more variables

There are many many ways to visualize additional variables in a plot 
and further explore your data.
We can use ggplot's colour, shape, size, transparency ("alpha"), 
and fill aesthetics, as well as "facets".
Faceting in ggplot2 is a way of splitting the plot up into multiple plots 
when the underlying aesthetics are the same or similar. 
In this section, we'll be covering many of these capabilities in ggplot2.

The most common and "prettiest" way of adding a third variable is by using colour.
Let's try to answer a few questions, to visualize some examples:

*Question*: Is systolic blood pressure different in those with 
or without diabetes in females and males? 
In this case, we have one continuous variable (`BPSysAve`)
and two discrete (`Sex` and `Diabetes`).
For this plot, we could use `geom_boxplot()`. 

```{r}
# Plot systolic blood pressure in relation to sex and diabetes status
nhanes_tidied %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = Sex, y = BPSysAve, colour = Diabetes)) +
    geom_boxplot()
```

*Question*: How does BMI relate to systolic blood pressure 
and age?
Here we have three continuous variables (`BMI`, `BPSysAve`, and `Age`),
so we could use `geom_point()`.

```{r}
# Plot BMI in relation to systolic blood pressure and age
nhanes_tidied %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = BMI, y = BPSysAve, colour = Age)) +
    geom_point()
```

*Question*: How does BMI relate to systolic blood pressure 
and what is different between those with and without diabetes?
In this case, we have two continuous (`BMI` and `BPSysAve`) and one discrete variable (`Diabetes`).
We could use `geom_point()`:

```{r}
# Plot BMI in relation to systolic blood pressure and diabetes status
nhanes_tidied %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = BMI, y = BPSysAve, colour = Diabetes)) +
    geom_point()
```

For this plot it's really hard to see what's different. 
But there is another way of visualizing a third (or fourth, and fifth!) variable:
with "faceting".
Faceting splits the plot up into multiple subplots
using the function `facet_grid()`.
To work, at least one of the first two arguments to `facet_grid()` are needed.
The first two are:

- `cols`: The discrete variable to use to facet the plot column-wise 
(i.e. side-by-side)
- `rows`: The discrete variable to use to facet the plot row-wise 
(i.e. stacked on top of each other)

For both `cols` and `rows`, the variable given must be wrapped by `vars()`
(e.g. `vars(Diabetes)`).
Let's try it with the previous example (instead of using `colour`).

```{r}
# Plot BMI in relation to systolic blood pressure and diabetes status using faceting
nhanes_tidied %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = BMI, y = BPSysAve)) +
    geom_point() +
    facet_grid(cols = vars(Diabetes))
```

Try facetting with plots stacked by diabetes status, using the argument rows = vars(Diabetes) instead. Which is more informative?

We can also facet by `Sex` and use `Age` as a colour:

```{r}
# Plot BMI in relation to systolic blood pressure, age, sex and diabetes status using faceting
nhanes_tidied %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = BMI, y = BPSysAve, colour = Age)) +
    geom_point() +
    facet_grid(rows = vars(Diabetes),
               cols = vars(Sex))
```

## Colours: Make your graphs more accessible

**Please take ~5 min to read through this section, as well as the next one.**

Colour blindness is common in the population, 
with red-green colour blindness in particular affecting about 8% of men 
and 0.5% of women. 
So to make your graph more accessible to people with colour blindness,
you need to consider the colours you use.
For more detail on how colours look to those with colour-blindness, 
check out this
[documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html) 
from the [viridis] package. 
The viridis colour scheme (also developed as an R package)
was specifically designed to represent data to all colour visions
(including as a grayscale, e.g. from black to white). 
There is a really good, informative 
[talk on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAoljeRJ3lU) on this topic.

[viridis]: https://cran.r-project.org/package=viridis

When using colours, think about what you are trying to convey in your figure 
and how your choice of colours will be interpreted. 
You can use built-in colour schemes or create your own. 
For now, let's stick to using built-in ones.
There are two: the viridis and the [ColorBrewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/) colour schemes. 
Both are well designed and are colour-blind friendly.
For this course, we will only cover the viridis package.

## Exercise: Changing the colour schemes

Time: 10 min

Practice changing colour schemes on a bar plot.
Start with a base plot object to work from that has two discrete variables. 
Copy and paste the code below into your script file.


```{r}
# Barplot to work from, with two discrete variables
base_barplot <- nhanes_tidied %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = Diabetes, fill = Sex)) +
    geom_bar(position = position_dodge())
```

Use the `scale_fill_` function to add the colour scheme. If you need help,
use the `help()` or `?` functions in RStudio to look over the documentation 
for more information or to see the other `scale_` functions. Use Tab Completion
to find the correct function.

1. Use the viridis scheme from `scale_fill_` to change the colours of the
`base_barplot` graph so that the plot is colour-blind friendly. Because the 
variables are discrete, you need to add `_d` to the end of the viridis scheme
function.

2. Viridis has several palettes. An the argument `options` with `"A"`. Run
the function again and see how the colour changes. Instead of `"A"`, change it
to `"E"`.

3. Now, let's practice using the colour schemes on a plot with continuous
variables. Copy and paste the code below into your exercise code chunk.
Since we are using `colour` instead of `fill`, the `scale_` will be `scale_colour_`.
Use this scale with viridis and use the function with `_c` at the end to indicate
the variable will be continuous.

    ```{r}
    # scatterplot to work from, with two continuous variables
    base_scatterplot <- nhanes_tidied %>% 
        ggplot(aes(x = BMI, y = BPSysAve, colour = Age)) +
        geom_point()
    ```
    
4. Like with 2 above, use the `options` argument and set it to first `"B"`,
run it to see how the colour changes, then switch it to `"C"` and run it
to see the colour differences.

```{r solution-colour-schemes, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# 1. change colors to a viridis color scheme
base_barplot +
    scale_fill_viridis_d()

# 2. change colors to another viridis color scheme
base_barplot +
    scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "A")
base_barplot +
    scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "E")

# 3. change colours to a viridis color scheme
base_scatterplot +
    scale_color_viridis_c()

# 4. change colors to another viridis color scheme
base_scatterplot +
    scale_color_viridis_c(option = "B")
base_scatterplot +
    scale_color_viridis_c(option = "C")
```

## Titles, axis labels, and themes

There are so so so many options to modify a ggplot2 figure.
Almost all of them are found in the `theme()` function. 
We won't cover individual theme items,
since the help with `?theme` 
and the [ggplot2 theme webpage] already document `theme()` really well.
So we'll instead cover a few of the built-in themes,
as well as setting the axes labels and plot title.
We'll build off of the previously created `base_scatterplot`.
All built-in themes start with `theme_`.

[ggplot2 theme webpage]: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/theme.html

```{r}
# create scatterplot to play with themes
base_scatterplot2 <- base_scatterplot +
    facet_grid(rows = vars(Diabetes),
               cols = vars(Sex)) +
    scale_color_viridis_c()

# View the plot with the default theme
base_scatterplot2

# Some pre-defined themes
base_scatterplot2 + theme_bw()
base_scatterplot2 + theme_minimal()
base_scatterplot2 + theme_classic()
```
You can also set the theme for all subsequent plots, by using the `theme_set()` function, specifying the theme you want in the parenthesis.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# set the theme for all subsequent plots
theme_set(theme_bw())
```

For adding labels to things, such as axis titles, the function is `labs()`.
To change the y-axis title, use the `y` argument in `labs()`.
For the x-axis, it is `x`.
For the whole plot, it is `title`:

```{r}
# add plot title, and change x and y axis titles
base_scatterplot2 +
    labs(title = "BMI, systolic blood pressure, and age by diabetes and sex.",
         y = "Systolic Blood Pressure (mmHg)",
         x = "BMI (kg/m2)")
```

## Saving the plot

Finally, to save the plot you created, use the `ggsave()` function.
The first argument says where to save the graph:
Give the name of the newly created file,
as well as the folder location (separate folders with `/`.
The next argument is the plot you want to save.
To set the dimensions of the figure, 
use `width` and `height` arguments.
But first, we need to create the `doc/images/` folder. 
We can do this with the fs (for "filesystem") package:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
fs::dir_create("doc/images")
```

Ok, now let's save that figure! 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# save the plot
ggsave(here::here("doc/images/scatterplot.pdf"), 
       base_scatterplot2, width = 7, height = 5)
```

## Summary of session {#dataviz-summary}

- Use the "Grammar of Graphics" with the ggplot2 package within the tidyverse to plot your data
- Prioritise plotting raw data data instead of summaries whenever possible or if able to
- ggplot2 has 4 levels of grammar: `aes()` (which data to plot), `geom_` (e.g. `geom_bar()` what kind of plot), `scale_` (making the plot pretty) and `theme()` (controls the surroundings of the plotting area)
- Only use bar plots for discrete values - if applying them on continuous variables, it hides the distribution of the data
- Use both colour, X and Y axis to plot three dimensions - or `facet_grid()` to plot more dimensions
- Use colourblind-friendly colours, e.g. by using the colour palettes `viridis` or `ColorBrewer`
- Save plots by `ggsave()`
