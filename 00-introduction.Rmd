# Pre-workshop tasks {#pre-workshop}

> NOTE: This is still being developed. Check back a few weeks before the start of the course.

No experience in data analysis or programming assumed or required. However,
before attending the workshop, there are a few *prerequisites* to complete.

1. Install the latest version of [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/index.html)
1. Install the latest version of [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
<!-- 1. Install the packages listed in the [Course Materials](/course/) -->
1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
1. Read or scan through [Chapter 1](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html) of
the online book "R for Data Science"
1. Make sure to bring your own laptop, since we do hands-on learning. 
1. Read and abide by the [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct)

## Instructors

Recommended number of instructors for a 25-35 class size is about 3-6
instructors (~1 instructors for every 1-2 sessions). If there are more instructors,
then less helpers are needed. The recommended combined total number of helpers
and instructors is about 6 for a smooth workflow experience for the learners.

## Recommended resources

- [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/): Excellent open and online resource for using R for data analysis and data science.
- [Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/): Excellent online resource for using ggplot2 and R graphics.
- [RStudio cheat sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/): Great quick reference.

## General schedule

The workshop is structured as a series of participatory live-coding sessions
(instructor and learner coding together) interspersed with hands-on exercises,
using either a practice dataset or the participants' own datasets. Some short 
lectures will be given throughout.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
options(knitr.kable.NA = "")
schedule <- readr::read_csv("data/schedule.csv")
knitr::kable(schedule, align = "l")
```

Notes: Describe assignments and form groups during introduction.
Get them in line from "complete beginner to computing" to "know a little bit".
Then assign numbers for groups then. Structure room into group tables, but get 
them to sit wherever but not get comfortable when they sit down (since they will
move).
