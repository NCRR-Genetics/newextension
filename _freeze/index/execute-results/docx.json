This website contains all of the material for the course, from\nreading material to exercises to code to images. It is structured as a\nbook, with \"chapters\" as lessons, given in order of appearance. We make\nheavy use of the website throughout the course where code-along sessions\nalmost identically follow the material on the website (with slight\nmodifications for time or more detailed explanations).\n\nThe course material was created using [Quarto](https://quarto.org) to\nwrite the lessons and create the book format,\n[GitHub](https://github.com/) to host the [Git](https://git-scm.com/)\nrepository of the material, and [GitHub\nActions](https://github.com/features/actions) with\n[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to build and host the website. The\noriginal source material for this course is found on the\n[`r-cubed-intro`](https://github.com/rostools/r-cubed-intro) Github\nrepository.\n\nWant to contribute to this course? Check out the\n[README](https://github.com/rostools/r-cubed-intro/blob/main/README.md)\nfile as well as the\n[CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/rostools/r-cubed-intro/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\nfile on the GitHub repository for more details. The main way to\ncontribute is by using [GitHub](https://github.com/) and creating a [new\nissue](https://github.com/rostools/r-cubed-intro/issues/new) to make\ncomments and give feedback on the material.\n\n## Target audiences\n\nThis website and its content are targeted to three groups:\n\n1.  For the **learners** to use during the course, both to follow along\n    in case they get lost and also to use as a reference after the\n    course ends. The learner is someone who is currently or will soon\n    actively be doing research (e.g. a PhD or postdoc), who is likely in\n    biomedical research, and who has no or little knowledge on coding\n    in R. A more detailed description of who the learner is can be found\n    in @sec-is-it-for-you.\n2.  For the **instructors** to use as a guide for when they do the\n    code-along sessions and lectures.\n3.  For those who are **interested in teaching**, who may not have much\n    experience or may not know where to start, to use this website as a\n    guide to running and instructing their own workshops.\n\n## Re-use and licensing\n\n<a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\"><img src=\"https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/4.0/80x15.png\" alt=\"Creative Commons License\" style=\"border-width:0\"/></a>\n\nThe course material is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution\n4.0 International\nLicense](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), so the material\ncan be used, re-used, and modified, as long as there is attribution to\nthis source.

Other\nparts were taken and modified from:\n\n-   The [Aarhus University CRU](https://au-cru.github.io/) sessions on\n    [project\n    management](https://au-cru.github.io/content/workflow-setup.html),\n    [data management and\n    wrangling](https://au-cru.github.io/content/intro-dplyr.html),\n    [intermediate dplyr and tidyr usage](https://au-cru.github.io/),\n    [data\n    visualization](https://au-cru.github.io/content/intro-ggplot2.html),\n    and [R\n    Markdown](https://au-cru.github.io/content/intro-rmarkdown.html).\n-   [A Git\n    session](https://uoftcoders.github.io/studyGroup/lessons/git/intro/lesson/),\n    given for the\n    [UofTCoders](https://uoftcoders.github.io/studyGroup/).\n-   The [UofTCoders Intro to R course for Ecology\n    students](https://uoftcoders.github.io/rcourse/).\n\nContent from multiple sources was used as inspiration for this course,\nincluding the [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) book and the\n[Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/).\n\nThe [Danish Diabetes Academy](https://www.danishdiabetesacademy.dk/)\nhosted, organized, and sponsored versions 1 and 2 of the course. A huge\nthanks to them for their involvement, support, and sponsorship!
