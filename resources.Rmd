### Setting up RStudio Cloud

**Are technical issues with your computer preventing you from completing the pre-course tasks or doing the course sessions?** 

A last-ditch solution may be to use the RStudio Cloud platform to do the course.
*What is it?*

RStudio Cloud is a cloud computing service hosted by RStudio. It runs RStudio in
your web browser with full functionality, including built-in integration of R
Projects and Git. It looks slightly different from a local RStudio session, and
it treats R Projects and Git a little different, but the overall R user
experience is virtually identical.
For what we need in this course, we are fine with their free service, which only requires a little work to register and set up.

**Setting up RStudio Cloud**

1. Register a free account: Go to the [RStudio Cloud website](https://rstudio.cloud/plans/free) and complete the sign-up process for a free account.
2. Log in to the account. After logging in, we start on the "Personal Workspace" page. Here we can create new R Projects (which we'll do next), set up additional workspaces (which we don't need for this course) or read the R guides and cheatsheets available in the "Learn" section of the menu panel (we can explore those after the course, there's a lot of good content):
```{r cloud-start, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="This is RStudio Cloud."}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images/cloud-start.jpg"))
```
3. Start a new R Project:  Click the "New Project" button. To practice using it, click the right half of the button and you get the option to create a project by cloning a GitHub repository (more on that later):
```{r cloud-new-project, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Create a new RStudio Cloud Project."}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images/cloud-new-project.jpg"))
```
We'll start a new project from scratch by clicking the button. Don't forget to click the top panel after the project has been created to rename it to something sensible. Great! Now we've set up an R Project:
```{r cloud-project, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Our first RStudio Cloud project. The interface is identical to a local instance of RStudio."}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images/cloud-project.jpg"))
```
Before we get ahead of ourselves, however, we'll tune the cloud computing settings for the project to get more monthly run-time out of our free account.
4. Throttle CPU and memory usage down: For this course, we don't need a lot of computer power, so we can get by with just the minimum memory and CPU settings. With these settings, we get 30 hours of run-time per month, which should be plenty for this course. To do so, click the gear-icon in the top right of the screen, then the "Resources" tab, toggle both sliders to the far left, and click "Apply Changes":
```{r cloud-cpu-memory, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Tuning cloud resources. Slow and steady wins the race!"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images/cloud-cpu-memory.jpg"))
```
If you end up requiring more memory or CPU power, you can always turn these settings up later. Cloud run-time is only accumulated while your project is active, so if you find yourself running low on run-time, make sure to exit your project when you're not actively coding.
6. Set up access to GitHub: Finally, we need to allow access to private GitHub repositories, which we'll be using in this course. Click on your user name in the top-right corner, and then the "Authentication" tab. This will take us to the authentication options, where we tick both boxes at the bottom for enabling GitHub, including the one labeled "Private repo access also enabled":
```{r cloud-settings-github, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Enable access to private repositories on GitHub."}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images/cloud-settings-github.jpg"))
```
7. Setting up Git on RStudio Cloud projects: Git cannot be set up inside the project using packages, so prodigenr and `usethis::use_git()` will not work. However, it can easily be done through the RStudio menu interface: `Tools -> Version Control -> Project Setup -> Version Control System: Git`
7. Now you're good to go! You should have no issues completing the [pre-course tasks](pre-course#getting-familiar-with-rstudio) and have a course experience similar to those using a local installation.
8. There are just a few more differences between local and RStudio Cloud sessions to be aware of:
    - **Uploading files to RStudio Cloud projects:** To make files available to RStudio Cloud projects, we have to upload the files to it. Thankfully, this is very easy! In RStudio Cloud the "Files" tab of Panel D (Figure \@ref(fig:rstudio-introduction)) contains a new icon "Upload File", which allows us to easily upload a file from our local computer (or several files within a zip file) to the RStudio Cloud folder we're currently in:
    ```{r cloud-upload, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Uploading files, e.g. datasets to the cloud is easy."}
    knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images/cloud-upload.jpg"))
    ```
    Another way of loading files to RStudio Cloud is to synchronize the project with a remote repository, which will download all the tracked files to the RStudio Cloud project.
    - **R projects and folder structure in RStudio Cloud:** Since we start every R session inside of a project on RStudio Cloud, RStudio in the cloud session doesn't let us set up projects from inside of the R session. The `prodigenr` package can still be used *through the console* to set up the basic folder structure of our projects. However, the root folder of any project is fixed to `/cloud/project/`, so when setting up our folder structure with prodigenr, we should have this in mind (e.g. `prodigenr::setup_project("LearningR")` creates the prodigenr folders inside`/cloud/project/LearningR` and avoids unnecessarily long file paths)
    - **Cloning a GitHub remote repository in RStudio Cloud:** Can be done when setting up a new project in the RStudio Cloud workspace ("New Project from Git Repo"), or from the terminal, but it cannot be done through the RStudio main menu interface.

### Potential exercise solutions

These are *potential* exercise solutions of R code only. This are mostly intended
as a resource for after the class, not during it.

```{r all-exercise-solutions, results="asis", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(magrittr)
source(here::here("R/extract-solutions.R"))
chapter_files <- fs::dir_ls(regexp = "^0[1-5]-.*.Rmd$")
solutions <- purrr::map(
    chapter_files,
    extract_solution_chunks
)
unlist(solutions) %>% 
    cat(sep = "\n")
```


## Resources for general use:

## More formatting syntax in Markdown {#post-course-markdown}

### Block quotes

Block quotes are used when you want to emphasize a block of text,
usually for quoting someone. 
You create a block quote by putting a `>` at the beginning of the line,
and as with the lists and headers, 
needs empty lines before and after the text.
So it looks like:

```markdown
> Block quote 
```

which gives...

> Block quote 

### Adding footnotes

Footnotes are added by enclosing a number or word in square brackets (`[]`)
and beginning with an uptick (`^`). It looks like:

```markdown
Footnote[^1] or this[^note].

[^1]: Footnote content
[^note]: Another footnote
```

which gives...

Footnote[^1] or this[^note].

[^1]: Footnote content
[^note]: Another footnote

### Adding links to websites

Including a link to a website in your document is done by surrounding the link text
with square brackets (`[]`) followed by the link URL in brackets (`()`).
There must not be any space between the square brackets 
and the regular brackets (it should look like `[]()`).

```markdown
[Link](https://google.com)
```

which gives...

[Link](https://google.com)

### Inserting (simple) tables

While you can insert tables using Markdown too, 
it isn't recommended to do that for complicated or large tables.
Tables are created by separating columns with `|`,
with the table header being separated by a line that looks like `|:--|`.
A simple example is:

```
|   | Fun | Serious |
|:--|----:|--------:|
| **Happy** | 1234 | 5678 |
| **Sad** | 123 | 456 |
```

which gives...

|   | Fun | Serious |
|:--|:---:|:-------:|
| **Happy** | 1234 | 5678 |
| **Sad** | 123 | 456 |

The `|---:|` or `|:---|` tell the table to left-align or right-align the values
in the column. Center-align is `|:----:|`.

So you can probably imagine,
doing this for larger or even slightly more complicated tables is not practical.
A good alternative approach is to create the table in a spreadsheet,
importing that table into R within a code chunk,
and using `knitr::kable()` to create the table after that.


## Other colour schemes in ggplot2

You can modify ggplot2 colour schemes using many other pre-defined palettes by
installing new R packages, including scientific journal colour palettes
([ggsci]) and even a Wes Anderson ([wesanderson]) or a Stubio Ghibli ([ghibli])
colour palette! 
Also check out the Data Visualization book in the [resources](resources.html)
chapter for more information and learning on visualizing data.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Installation Problems

**Q: What do I do if I don't have admin rights and can't install the newest versions of programs?**

- A: Depending on your institutional policies and infrastructure, you may not be able to download newer versions of R and RStudio. Firstly, you should contact your IT support person to see whether you are able to access an updated version. While you could attempt to use the older version of these programs available to you, you may notice that some things either look quite different or not work at all. One solution is to use the RStudio Cloud platform, as per the instructions in the section [Setting up RStudio Cloud](#setting-up-rstudio-cloud).

**Q: Why did my output have so much red text when I tried to install packages?**

- A: Rest assured that this is simply the way that R informs you that packages are being installed, even though it may look scary. If there really was an error, the output would likely begin with a message saying "Error: ..." or "Warning: ...", to differentiate between informational compared to error messages. 

**Q: Why did I receive a bunch of error messages when I tried to install packages?**

- A: For some Windows users, you may need to install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/Rtools35.exe).

**Q: Help! My code isn't working, even though I've followed all the instructions.**

- A: This is the most common problem you will face, so we've dedicated Section
\@ref(encountering-problems-and-finding-help) to troubleshooting solutions in the
[Management of R Projects](r-project-management.html) section.
