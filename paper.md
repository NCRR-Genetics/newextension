## Description of the Submission

# Explanation of its eligibility for JOSE
This submission relates to a computational learning module that has been developed and implemented as an open educational resource. The resource can be applied to diverse educational contexts, and is immediately useable for adoption by learners, instructors, and others interested in teaching.

## Statement of Need

# Contribution to computationally-enabled teaching and learning
(Pending literature review and comparison with existing courses)
Introduce reproducibility here?

# How the learning modules can be adopted by others
On the basis of authors' affilitations and fields of research, the content of the learning module was developed and framed in the context of the medical sciences (diabetes, specifically). Nonetheless, the resource can easily be applied to other sciences and disciplines. Refer to Section 1.1 of the online resource, for a more comprehensive description of how others may adopt learning resources with minimal expertise in RStudio.
(Introduce DDA events as a clear example)

# Target audience
The learning module is suitable for anyone wishing to enhance their reproducibility practices and/or be introduced to RStudio as a means of doing so. Based on previous experience of use in teaching and learning, the course has suited PhD and post-doctoral level researchers well.

## Description of Learning Modules

# Learning Objectives
The objective of this learning module is to teach reproducible research practices. Upon completion of the learning module, learners are expected to have: 1) a basic level of proficiency in using the R statistical programming language; 2) improved data and code literacy; and 3) an ability to conduct a modern and reproducible data analysis. Section 2 ("Syllabus") details how sub-modules are structured to achieve these objectives.

# Learning Content and Sequence
The learning module encompasses five sub-modules (see Table 1). Each sub-module is taught across multiple sessions. Section 2.2 and Appendix C detail how these lessons can be structured.

Table 1. Overview of sub-modules.
|Sub-module|Description|
|---|---|
|Management of R Projects|Introducing RStudio and R Projects; using packages, data, and file paths; and learning how to troubleshoot|
|Version Control with Git|Using Git with RStudio; synchronizing Git with GitHub; dealing with file conflicts; and using Git as a collaboration tool|
|Data Management and Wrangling|Introducing good working practices (i.e., "tidy" data); loading data and packages in to RStudio; and transforming data using select, rename, filter, arrange, and split-apply-combine functions|
|Analytically Reproducible Documents|Introducing R Markdown and inserting code, tables, and figures in R Markdown|
|Data Visualization|Plotting various combinations of variables and using formatting effectively|

Sub-modules are designed to be completed as a series in the order in which they are presented, since concepts taught in later sub-modules are dependent on earlier lessons. Principles and applications of reproducibility are highlighted throughout sub-modules. Sub-modules are accompanied by three stand-alone lectures aimed at drawing together reproducibility and RStudio skills (see Section 6 "Lecture Slides"). 

# Instructional Design
When delivered face-to-face, workshops involve a combination of teaching methods (see Table 2). Content taught using the methods below are all contained within the online learing module (LINK). 

Table 2. Description of teaching methods.
|Method|Description|Advantages|
|---|---|---|
|Participatory live coding lessons|Participants join with instructors to write and troubleshoot code step-by-step|Encourages participants to engage with the material and learn how to handle mistakes, rather than passively observing content|
|Independent reading and completion of brief exercises|Participants read and complete assigned sections of the learning module|Offers participants hands-on opportunities to apply skills taught in previous lessons|
|Group assignment work|Participants collaborate with others to apply skills taught over the course in terms of cleaning, manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing messy data|Helps to reinforce learning and build confidence in using skills|

Appendix C further describes the teaching approach that instructors should adopt to maximize learning outcomes.

# Teaching and Learning Experiences
The learning module has been delivered face-to-face twice previously in two- to three-day events sponsored by the Danish Diabetes Academy. In these instances, the learning module was taught by X instructors and X helpers. Instructors were graduate students from diverse fields of science research, who had well-established reproducibility practices or were proficient in the use of R. Helpers were X PhD and post-doctoral researchers in the field of diabetes that had recently learned R themselves, and thus had recent experiential learning to share with current course participants (i.e., on how to troubleshoot code). It was determined that X (total number) of instructors and helpers would be sufficient in effectively teaching content and attuning to the needs of course participants as lessons were being conducted.

Course participants were approximately 20 to 25 PhD and post-doctoral researchers in the field of diabetes, most of which were beginners in terms of their exposure to R and understanding of reproducibility. Participants were grouped into clusters of four to five people, in order to facilitate the group assignment work later in the course. Participants were encouraged to use sticky notes placed at the top of their laptop screens to indicate whether they had either successfully completed the task or were needing further support to troubleshoot a problem.

Participant feedback on the structure and content of the course was collected via a post-course survey, and was used to inform modifications to the materials to ensure that the learinng module is well-structured, relevant, and otherwise user-friendly. See Feedback for anonymous testimonials from former participants.
