## Description of the Submission
In the past years, the amount of biological data to be analyzed has increased. 
Unfortunately, doing a clear and concise data analsysis has not kept pace with the speed of data analysis. 
Too often, it is not only a matter of replication other results in another data set, but it even because impossible for researchers to reproduce their own results. 
In this submission, we describe an online and computational learning module which is eglible as an open educational resource. 
All modules are for immediate use, either for self-learning or by instructors. The learning modules have been developed as a three-day course, but each moduel can be used independently. 
Throughout the learning module, the focus is put on multiple researchers working on the same project, and how to keep track on changes in the project is in focus. 
These learning modules are needed to learn how to conduct clear and concise reproducible research. 
This course is thus not build on novel software, but rather involves how to use exsisting programs as R and GitHub. 
Furthermore. this module teaches how to find open data sets and make use of free platforms as GitHub. 
All content is under the CC-BY license, and can be used. 


# Explanation of its eligibility for JOSE
This submission relates to a computational learning module that has been developed and implemented as an open educational resource. The resource can be applied to diverse educational contexts, and is immediately useable for adoption by learners, instructors, and others interested in teaching.
- It is a ready-to-take course that also can be done independently of a class.  

## Statement of Need
Reproducibility is very important in modern research. Too often, researchers cannot reproduce their own results due to a lot of manual data processing. We need more clear guidlines and a concise idea of what has happened to the data. This is importnat, not only for the society, but also for the researcher him/herself. 
- Furthermore, we need more a open data handling process. Too often, when reading through materials and method sections in scoientific papers, these are very limited and "narrow/small/skrabede"... This makes it difficult for other researchers to 1) replicate the data analysis and 2) learn from (a) potentially good science/method.
- Learning how to use version control is very useful for both indivual and group project, as changes within the project can be tracked when it progresses. This will save the persons, using the version control, a lot of time and make it "gennemskueligt/clear and consice". 

# Contribution to computationally-enabled teaching and learning
(Pending literature review and comparison with existing courses)
Introduce reproducibility here?
- Rmarkdown, code-along. Something about it is a useful way to learn by code-along. 

# How the learning modules can be adopted by others
On the basis of authors' affilitations and fields of research, the content of the learning module was developed and framed in the context of the medical sciences (diabetes, specifically). Nonetheless, the resource can easily be applied to other sciences and disciplines. Refer to Section 1.1 of the online resource, for a more comprehensive description of how others may adopt learning resources with minimal expertise in RStudio.
(Introduce DDA events as a clear example). 
- Maybe we can find someone else who want to test it? Or state that we would be happy to hear feedback if others have tested it

# Target audience
The learning module is suitable for anyone wishing to enhance their reproducibility practices and/or be introduced to RStudio as a means of doing so. Based on previous experience of use in teaching and learning, the course has suited PhD and post-doctoral level researchers well.
- Probably most suited for people who are doing data analysis and/or research. 
A very important thing is the introduction of Git/version control. This is a beneficial way for several people to work on the same project and keep track of changes in the project as it progresses. With the "user-friendly" (it is to a certain degree) outline/visualisation/buttons in R, it makes it easy for most people to use, despite the background, and the result from using version control will save many data analysts a lot of time!

## Description of Learning Modules
Guess this is quite "simply" - a brief describtion. Mal can do it. 
Just not quite sure what a learning module is - is it e.g. chapter 7 - data management?
Then the learning modules are
1. Management of R projects
2. Version control
3. Data management and wrangling
4. Analytically reproducible documents 
5. Data visualization 


# Learning objectives
Upon completion of the learning modules, learners are expected to have: 1) a basic level of proficiency in using the R statistical programming language; 2) improved data and code literacy; and 3) an ability to conduct a modern and reproducible data analysis. See Section 2 for a more detailed description of how the learning modules are structured to achieve these objectives, including the questions that are addressed throughout learning module content.

# Content and sequence of learning materials
The online resource encompasses five core modules, including:
- Project management
- Version control with Git
- Data wrangling
- Analytically reproducible documents
- Data visualization

Principles of reproducibility will be highlighted in each module. Modules should be completed as a series, in the order in which they are presented in the online resource, as concepts taught in later modules are dependent on concepts learned in earlier ones. Modules are accompanied by three stand-alone lectures adressing related topics, aimed at drawing together reproducibility and RStudio skills. 
- A word on version control here too?

# Instructional design
When the learning module is delivered face-to-face, workshops involve a combination of live coding lessons and independent reading/exercises. See Appendix C for further details on instructors' approach, in terms of "thinking out loud" when introducing new concepts. Otherwise, learners are able to work their way through readings and exercises in a self-guided manner. 
The use of stickies makes the course even more interactive, and is a suitable way to get help fast. 

# Experience of use in teaching and learning situations
The learning modules have been delivered face-to-face via two multiple-day coursework events sponsored by the Danish Diabetes Academy. In these instances, approximately 20 to 25 PhD and post-doctoral researchers in the field of diabetes attended. Course participants reported varying levels of proficiency with R and understanding of reproducibility, upon entry to the course. However, most were beginners in both senses. Similarly, instructors were PhD and post-doctoral researchers in the field of diabetes that had recently (i.e., in the previous 1-2 years) adopted R for their own projects, and thus had recent experiential learning on how to problem-solve difficulties. See Section 2.2 and Appendix C for further details on how workshops were structured and conducted by course instructors.

Feedback was collected via a post-course survey to inform future modifications of the learning modules, and was later used adapt materials to be more relevant, important, and user-friendly. See Feedback for anonymous testimonials from former participants. General themes were requests for less time to be spent on formatting changes in RStudio and more time to be spent on thought-provoking lectures regarding challenges in replicability/reproducibility studies.

- Other issues that arose during this course were installation if Rpackages on computers controled by regional institutions, e.g. hospitals. Ways to cconquer such issues have been described in Appendix A2 and can be used in other scenarioes. 

- The helpers and instructors were not pure R experts (it is though recommened to have at least one (Luke!)). This created a special athmosphere during the course, and it set the standard and tone during the course which created a work-friendly environment.  

(Description of previous self-guided use?)

## Story of the Project
Going from each reseacher sitting with their own data management, a hundred different version controls (PhDcomics) and not being able to reproduce their own results, to a clear and concise data processing with openness about the science going on, so eryone can benefint from the methods and data processing. 

# How it came about and authors' experience
Very interesting topic to work with, and the authord learned a lot themselves too. Also beneficial for the authors to keep learning, using, making it a habit and distributing the idea of open science.
