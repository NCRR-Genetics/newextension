## Description of the Submission

# Explanation of its eligibility for JOSE
This submission relates to a computational learning module that has been developed and implemented as an open educational resource. The resource can be applied to diverse educational contexts, and is immediately useable for adoption by learners, instructors, and others interested in teaching.

## Statement of Need

# Contribution to computationally-enabled teaching and learning
(Pending literature review and comparison with existing courses)
Introduce reproducibility here?

# How the learning modules can be adopted by others
On the basis of authors' affilitations and fields of research, the content of the learning module was developed and framed in the context of the medical sciences (diabetes, specifically). Nonetheless, the resource can easily be applied to other sciences and disciplines. Refer to Section 1.1 of the online resource, for a more comprehensive description of how others may adopt learning resources with minimal expertise in RStudio.
(Introduce DDA events as a clear example)

# Target audience
The learning module is suitable for anyone wishing to enhance their reproducibility practices and/or be introduced to RStudio as a means of doing so.

## Description of Learning Modules

# Learning objects
XYZ

# Content and sequence of learning materials
(Ensure strong focus on reproducibility here)
The online resource encompassses five core modules, including:
- Project management
- Version control with Git
- Data wrangling
- Analytically reproducible documents
- Data visualization

Modules should be completed as a series, in the order in which they are presented in the online resource, as concepts taught in later modules are dependent on concepts learned in earlier ones. Modules are accompanied by three stand-alone lectures adressing related topics, aimed at drawing together reproducibility and RStudio skills. 

# Instructional design
When the learing module is delivered via face-to-face coursework for participants, workshops involve a combination of live coding lessons and independent reading/exercises. See Appendix C for further details on instructors' approach, in terms of "thinking out loud" when introducing new concepts.

# Experience of use in teaching and learning situations
See Feedback folder for anonymous testimonials from former course participants (in two previous iterations of the face-to-face course). Feedback was used to directly modify course material to be more relevant, important, and user-friendly, General themes of feedback included less time spent on formatting changes in RStudio and more time spent on thought-provoking lectures regarding challenges in replicability/reproducibility studies.
