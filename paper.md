## Description of the Submission

# Explanation of its eligibility for JOSE
This submission relates to a computational learning module that has been developed and implemented as an open educational resource. The resource can be applied to diverse educational contexts, and is immediately useable for adoption by learners, instructors, and others interested in teaching.

## Statement of Need

# Contribution to computationally-enabled teaching and learning
(Pending literature review and comparison with existing courses)
Introduce reproducibility here?

# How the learning modules can be adopted by others
On the basis of authors' affilitations and fields of research, the content of the learning module was developed and framed in the context of the medical sciences (diabetes, specifically). Nonetheless, the resource can easily be applied to other sciences and disciplines. Refer to Section 1.1 of the online resource, for a more comprehensive description of how others may adopt learning resources with minimal expertise in RStudio.
(Introduce DDA events as a clear example)

# Target audience
The learning module is suitable for anyone wishing to enhance their reproducibility practices and/or be introduced to RStudio as a means of doing so. Based on previous experience of use in teaching and learning, the course has suited PhD and post-doctoral level researchers well.

## Description of Learning Modules

# Learning objectives
Upon completion of the learning modules, learners are expected to have: 1) a basic level of proficiency in using the R statistical programming language; 2) improved data and code literacy; and 3) an ability to conduct a modern and reproducible data analysis. See Section 2 for a more detailed description of how the learning modules are structured to achieve these objectives, including the questions that are addressed throughout learning module content.

# Content and sequence of learning materials
The online resource encompasses five core modules, including:
- Project management
- Version control with Git
- Data wrangling
- Analytically reproducible documents
- Data visualization

Principles of reproducibility will be highlighted in each module. Modules should be completed as a series, in the order in which they are presented in the online resource, as concepts taught in later modules are dependent on concepts learned in earlier ones. Modules are accompanied by three stand-alone lectures adressing related topics, aimed at drawing together reproducibility and RStudio skills. 

# Instructional design
When the learning module is delivered face-to-face, workshops involve a combination of live coding lessons and independent reading/exercises. See Appendix C for further details on instructors' approach, in terms of "thinking out loud" when introducing new concepts. Otherwise, learners are able to work their way through readings and exercises in a self-guided manner. 

# Experience of use in teaching and learning situations
The learning modules have been delivered face-to-face via two multiple-day coursework events sponsored by the Danish Diabetes Academy. In these instances, approximately 20 to 25 PhD and post-doctoral researchers in the field of diabetes attended. Course participants reported varying levels of proficiency with R and understanding of reproducibility, upon entry to the course. However, most were beginners in both senses. Similarly, instructors were PhD and post-doctoral researchers in the field of diabetes that had recently (i.e., in the previous 1-2 years) adopted R for their own projects, and thus had recent experiential learning on how to problem-solve difficulties. See Section 2.2 and Appendix C for further details on how workshops were structured and conducted by course instructors.

Feedback was collected via a post-course survey to inform future modifications of the learning modules, and was later used adapt materials to be more relevant, important, and user-friendly. See Feedback for anonymous testimonials from former participants. General themes were requests for less time to be spent on formatting changes in RStudio and more time to be spent on thought-provoking lectures regarding challenges in replicability/reproducibility studies.
