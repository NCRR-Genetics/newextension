# Pre-course tasks {#pre-course}

## Initial tasks

The very first things to do are to:

1. Install the latest [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/index.html) version 
(`r rversions::r_release()$version`)
1. Install the latest version of [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Once R, RStudio, and Git have been installed, open RStudio. 
*If you at any point during these pre-course tasks have any troubles*, 
let us know in the pre-course survey, which is linked at the end of these tasks.
Watch the video below to get a quick introduction to the RStudio interface:

## Installing R packages

Now that you have RStudio and R on your computer, 
we need to install the R packages we'll use in the course.
R packages are external bundles of R code that other people have written.
There are so many R packages available 
and if there is something you'd like to do in R, 
there probably is an R package for doing it. 
Making use of R packages can seriously help you out when doing your research.

Alright, you'll need to install the remotes package.
See the GIF in Figure \@ref(fig:rstudio-installing-remotes) below for how to do that:

```{r rstudio-installing-remotes, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Installing the remotes package in RStudio."}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images/rstudio-installing-remotes.gif"))
```

Then type in the RStudio Console the commands below. 
Check out the GIF in Figure \@ref(fig:console-installing-r3) 
below for how to do that.
Hit enter and the r3 helper package will be installed.

```r
remotes::install_gitlab("rostools/r3")
```

```{r console-installing-r3, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Using the RStudio Console to install the r3 helper package."}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images/console-install-r3.gif"))
```

*Note*: When you see a command like `something::something()`,
for example with `remotes::install_gitlab()`, you would "read" this as:

> R, can you please use the install_gitlab function from the remotes package.

The normal way of doing it would be to load the package with `library(remotes)` 
and then run the command.
But by using the `::`, we tell R to directly use a function from a package.
We use this trick because we only want to use the `install_gitlab()` command
from the remotes package and nothing else. 
We will be using this more as we go along.

## Setting up Git and GitHub

We'll cover what Git and GitHub is during the course, 
but for now we need you to get things ready beforehand so it's easier in the course.
In order to use Git properly, 
we need to inform your computer that you are using Git.
Since we've installed the r3 package and 
we only want to use specific commands from it, 
we'll be using `r3::` often. 
So, type in the RStudio Console:

```r
r3::setup_git()
```

Hit enter and follow the instructions. 
Afterward, type and run this command to make sure everything is ok with the Git configuration.
You should see your name and your email printed.

```r
r3::check_git_config()
```

After you are done, we need to [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join). 
**Note**, *GitHub* is a company and website, while *Git* is a software.
There is sometimes confusion about these two things since they both say "Git",
and it's important to recognize they are two *separate* things.

```{r github-account-creation, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Creating a GitHub account."}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images/github-account-creation.gif"))
```

## Course introduction

Most of the description of the course is found in the [syllabus](syllabus).
For quickly going to the syllabus from RStudio, 
run the command `r3::open_syllabus()`.
Or click it from the menu bar on the side.
If you haven't read it, **please read it now**.
Read over what the course will cover, 
what we expect you to learn at the end of it,
and what our basic assumptions are about who you are and what you know.
At the end of this pre-course assignment we'll ask you a few questions to see
if you understand what you'll learn in the course.

One goal of the course is to educate on open science,
and true to our mission, we practice what we preach.
The course material is publicly accessible (all on this website) and 
[openly licensed](license) so you can use and re-use it!
The material is ordered as we will cover it during the course.
Even though the course will include lots of hands-on work during the sessions,
there is also the final group [project](assignment) 
to practice in a team what you've learned.
To quickly access the final project from inside RStudio,
run the command `r3::open_assignment()`.

We have a [Code of Conduct](conduct). Access it quickly with `r3::open_conduct()`. 
If you haven't read it, **read it now**.
At the end there will be a survey that will ask some questions about Conduct.
We want to make sure this course is a supportive and safe environment for learning,
so this Code of Conduct is important.

You're almost done. Please fill out the pre-course survey as part of the assignment.

```r
r3::open_pre_survey()
```
