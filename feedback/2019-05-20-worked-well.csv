"Over the last three days, what do you feel or think worked well or that you would like to see more of? Please add as many comments as you want!!"
"it was a well structured course
the online material in parallel is helpful to check at a later stage again
the basic codes were really helpful"
"The course was generally very well structured and useful. The online availability of the course material is great and the material helpful. The part that worked best and is probably the most useful for future work, was the data visualization."
"Some of the scripts did not work because the online guide and the on-Course material was not 100% identical, so a more synchronised Course-to-online guide script Situation would maybe help clarify some Things."
"The exercises, especially the short ones. The long ones at the end, were sometimes a bit overwhelming and then that was sometimes demotivating"
The method with the blue and orange sticky notes was very useful
"Creation of pdf documents using R Markdown worked very well. But I very often got lost in these big functions because I didn't really now, why am I typing in what I was typing."
"Luke's disposition to explain and good environment. Always willing to stop the class to help the ones who were behind.  
The detail webpage with the contents was very nice, in general, the organization of the course was very good. 
THANK YOU! :)"
Statistics in R would be great (we did not know that this was not gonna covered in the course.
"I have been programming in Perl and Python but never spent time to formally learn R. In hindsight, I should have done that long ago. Sothis course was extremely useful in that sense, learning R in a more formal manner."
I liked the fact that there were exercises
"The course structure was good, materials wise I think its good as well as many of the course paritcipants were new to R so the course content was suitable."
Luke was very enthusiastic and inspiring
I like that the course material is freely available online
"A one week course would be great. Starting from the capabilities of base R and then moving along to packages such as ggplot2, comparing and contrasting the two and giving people more time to appreciate the utility of R."
Structure of the course was well set up
I really liked the sessions on visualisation of data and on efficient coding. The latter one could get some more time.
"I liked the final rant about the current state of science and the incentive/reward system. 
The selection of session topics was well balanced and really helpful for my current projects.

Coding exercise were exactly right in terms of level"
Great that you are really engaged and enthusiastic about your topics.
It was a nice group and good atmosphere.
"worked well: open minded communication, a lot of helpers in the group
see more: explanation of the codes (hard to judge, was for sure enough explained for people with experience, but to less for beginners)"
"Reproducible research section was extremely useful too. However, I would have liked to see the use of more than R code (such as embedding python or perl) in the R package. Lastly, teaching how to use R interface to python would also be cool-"
Course materials are well written and structured. Exercises are build on previously explained material and therefore easily done.
"Final exercises are quite complicated and required to remember the stuff from the whole day and sometimes from previous days. That's good, because shows gaps which have to be filled/repeated using course materials."
The Markdown session really revealed how useful this could be for me.
Exercises are always good
General atmoshpere was very good. Keep on
"The course atmosphere is very nice and friendly with constantly supporting by Luke. Totally, I'm very happy with a course!"
"Good balance between input and exercises. I relly need the exercise time to at least get the teaser for using really helpful functions, shortcuts, etc"
