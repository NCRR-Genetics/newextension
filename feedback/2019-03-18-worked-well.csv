"From the last two days, what do you feel or think worked well or that you would like to see more of?"
"We could have gone through the github here as well, by using it again with the markdown file. We could have the 'whats next?' page on the webpage - so that there are good next steps provided for the ones, who dont know where from to continue to learn"
advanced course of data reproducibility and programming
"the support from the 'assistants' was great. You need that to allow everyone to follow the course. Luke's enthousiasm. R markdown rocks"
I really enjoyed the code along. There is a good mix of lectures and hands on sessions.
"Everything, especially the practical exercises. Great course, learned  a lot!"
The code along was very helpful (more hands on)
I liked working in assigned groups. I learned much from it. Thank you for the great course :)
mix of hand-on coding and lecture worked well. great with a few more breaks
I learned a lot from the group assignment.
It was good to do the assignment (but we did not need so much time in class). I would have liked more excercises. We had a lot of coding a long but I learn alot from the excercises. Otherwise a really good course with some very good instructors:)
"I love R markdown as a publication tool. so, you might want to elaborate more in relation to this topic."
Nice with the group work but maybe a fixed data set would have been good to avoid spending to much time finding one and figure out how to use it.
"I appreciate the list of online resources that have been indicated during the course. Also, it is a good idea to stay at a hotel and be able to network."
worked well: course material is understandable and teachers were all the time around! Awesome job! see more: do more exercises to learn how to deal with data
The time to do group work. The number of instructors. The time on lectures.
Nice mix of lectures and code along
I think the dynamic of the teaching team is working very well and the support and assistance was great.
"I missed some more exercises to do with Rmarkdown, but there was no time for them"
Good  and helpful teachers.
This course gets you hooked on R :-)
The assignment put everything into perspective (were able to reinforce what we learned).
