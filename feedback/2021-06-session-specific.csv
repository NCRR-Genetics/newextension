Day 1,Management of R projects,"BAsically everything worked well. The material is clear and it's nice that most of the coding is done as ""code along"".",Perhaps a little more pre-course preparation would be nice to get some background knowledge of git - basically just reading the material that we read during the day. I just find it hard to concentrate on reading rather than listening or watching during the course day.

Day 1,Version control and collaborative practices,"Same as for ""Management of R projects"" session.","See previous answer for ""Management of R projects"" session""."
Day 1,Version control and collaborative practices,"That we did the commit push pull many times - that helped me understanding better how Rstudio, GIt and Github are linked/connected","I felt that we went a bit fast over the ""Work a long"" parts so I had a hard time actually following the coding"
Day 1,Version control and collaborative practices,Really good examples and explanations on why Git is handy to use,Learning a bit more about history - that you can see the changes you've made there.

Day 2,Data management and wrangling,Code-along was nice.,It's a bit too bad that you visually couldn't see the console output during the wrangling code-along. It's very nice to physically see that you added e.g. the log_height column.
Day 2,Data management and wrangling,It was nice to get some basic feeling of R-codes and to have focus on the basic Things to do before actually making dataanalysis/figures,"a bit more on why the coding is as it is, i.e. when do we have a function and what is arguments and how do the link to each other"
Day 2,Data management and wrangling,It was really good to code along. It could be nice to also get an example why it is ness for clean the data.,It is good - no comments

Day 3,Data visualization,Data visualization with coding along was great!!!,Learning how to changed name of columns e.g. diabetes yes no
Day 3,Data visualization,Covered a lot of graphs and how and when to make them. I like how it was organized,"I think we need more resources for how to customize graphs. Maybe an ""optional"" thing with a few key ways to modify graphs? Because otherwise I feel it is hard to convince people to move from something like Prism."
Day 3,Data visualization,It provides with a great overall skill in data visualization.,"Get to know how choose specific colors, fond and the design of figure"
Day 3,Data visualization,"Super cool. It was nice to see the feature, and the possibilities.",It was just perfect. The pace and details were appropiate
Day 3,Data visualization,very pretty graphs,"it sometimes went a little fast and then the screen moved to the image, so we couldnt see the code"

Day 3,Data visualization,"The instructor was good at saying what she typed, i.e. ""this is the package, this is the function in the package"" etc.",can't come up with anything
Day 3,Data visualization,Showing how to utilize the %>% together with geom_ . Working directly in the R markdown was also great,"More a general thing; it could also be practical if some of the scripts did not work, and one would have to figure out why/how to fix it."
Day 3,Data visualization,"As for the previous sessions and days, the code-along format works very well!","Perhaps a few practical examples of why it's better to use ggplot instead of base R plotting? And in general,  a short explanation of how and when different packages work together and when they don't?"
