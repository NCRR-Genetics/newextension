Questions,Responses
TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU THINK THE OVERALL PROGRAMME WAS WELL COMPOSED?,The course was well organized
TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU THINK THE OVERALL PROGRAMME WAS WELL COMPOSED?,It was easy to follow and with space to make mistakes and ask for help
TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU THINK THE OVERALL PROGRAMME WAS WELL COMPOSED?,"It is probably impossible to find the perfect sequence of sessions - like do you start with R markdown before Git and so on. I would have liked that the group work was in the end after all the individual sessions. This would have made it more representative of starting a ""real"" project in R."
TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU THINK THE OVERALL PROGRAMME WAS WELL COMPOSED?,I thought it was very well organized and you could tell that a lot of planning/consideration had gone into the scheduling.
TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU THINK THE SCIENTIFIC LEVEL OF THE PROGRAMME WAS SUITABLE FOR AN INTRODUCTORY COURSE?,Too much time spent learning programs outside R
TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU THINK THE SCIENTIFIC LEVEL OF THE PROGRAMME WAS SUITABLE FOR AN INTRODUCTORY COURSE?,"Sometimes if went too fast in the coding along sessions. If you had problems with your coding and needed help, then it sometimes was hard to follow the instructions and understand the new instructions of coding."
TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU THINK THE SCIENTIFIC LEVEL OF THE PROGRAMME WAS SUITABLE FOR AN INTRODUCTORY COURSE?,I could have used a bit more introduction e.g. how to read in a dataset ect
TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU THINK THE SCIENTIFIC LEVEL OF THE PROGRAMME WAS SUITABLE FOR AN INTRODUCTORY COURSE?,"I think that there could have been less time spent on plot captions/colours and R Markdown style options, and more time spent on application of certain functions/commands/tools."
TO WHAT EXTENT DID YOU FIND THE PRE-COURSE MATERIAL AND TASKS VALUABLE FOR YOUR OUTCOME OF THE COURSE?,I would add exercises to do after the course
TO WHAT EXTENT DID YOU FIND THE PRE-COURSE MATERIAL AND TASKS VALUABLE FOR YOUR OUTCOME OF THE COURSE?,Absolutely necessary to have things installed and running beforehand!
TO WHAT EXTENT DID YOU FIND THE PRE-COURSE MATERIAL AND TASKS VALUABLE FOR YOUR OUTCOME OF THE COURSE?,It was a useful opportunity to install appropriate software and begin to familiarise myself with the tools that we would be using during the course.
TO WHAT EXTENT WERE THE LECTURES AND CODE-ALONGS BALANCED THROUHOUT THE COURSE?,It was really good to spent most of the time in working in the computer rather than listening lectures
TO WHAT EXTENT WERE THE LECTURES AND CODE-ALONGS BALANCED THROUHOUT THE COURSE?,more coding better
TO WHAT EXTENT WERE THE LECTURES AND CODE-ALONGS BALANCED THROUHOUT THE COURSE?,I learned most from the code along sessions
TO WHAT EXTENT WERE THE LECTURES AND CODE-ALONGS BALANCED THROUHOUT THE COURSE?,I would have liked more lectures (particularly on the Open Science content that Daniel touched on in the last day).
TO WHAT EXTENT WERE YOU SATISFIED WITH THE GROUP WORK?,I would add half of an hour more
TO WHAT EXTENT WERE YOU SATISFIED WITH THE GROUP WORK?,We could have needed a bit more time and more guidance
TO WHAT EXTENT WERE YOU SATISFIED WITH THE GROUP WORK?,A little more time would have been good. It was a little stressfull at times
TO WHAT EXTENT WERE YOU SATISFIED WITH THE GROUP WORK?,"One suggestion could be to assign an instructor to each group, that stays with the group. This way that instructor will better be able to pinpoint specific data issues."
TO WHAT EXTENT WERE YOU SATISFIED WITH THE GROUP WORK?,We could have used more time for the group work.
TO WHAT EXTENT WERE YOU SATISFIED WITH THE GROUP WORK?,"It had a bit of a chaotic feeling to it because of the challenges with finding data and figuring out how to use R, Github and Rmarkdown. But overall it worked well."
TO WHAT EXTENT WERE YOU SATISFIED WITH THE GROUP WORK?,I found it was a little chaotic and disorganized. Four people trying to understand very foreign concepts.
TO WHAT EXTENT ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH THE COMMUNICATION (INCLUDING COURSE INFORMATION) PRIOR TO THE COURSE?,"We received the prior materials and reminders for the course, which were very helpful"
TO WHAT EXTENT ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH THE COMMUNICATION (INCLUDING COURSE INFORMATION) PRIOR TO THE COURSE?,"Fantastic, no problems."
TO WHAT EXTENT DID YOU GET THE REQUIRED INFORMATION ON TIME?,"Again, it was very well communicated and no problems."
TO WHAT EXTENT ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH THE OVERALL ORGANISATION OF THE COURSE?,"I liked the organisation overall, but it could be an idea to follow the introduction to R with the Rmarkdown. It was a bit confusing with the github in the middle of learning R."
What should the DDA keep for a similar course in the future?,Practical live coding sessions
What should the DDA keep for a similar course in the future?,"Yes, definitely. It was a very beneficial course and improved my capabilities a lot witihin a very limited time."
What should the DDA keep for a similar course in the future?,"R is a very powerful tool, which will facilitate our research. Future course could also consider statistical method training in R/stata/spss, like multi-level methods, time-to-event methods, etc. Or general courses like Meta analysis, literature review tools, etc."
What should the DDA keep for a similar course in the future?,The format was good maybe start explaining git first but in general I consider the structure was good and also the number of helpers and the size of the group was very important to work and also that was 3 days
What should the DDA keep for a similar course in the future?,The organisation and the hotel. Very great location
What should the DDA keep for a similar course in the future?,All teh code along processes with solo tasks at the end
What should the DDA keep for a similar course in the future?,"Yes, the course was very good and rewarding. Not least the information about open science and reproducibility was very rewarding. I will recommend it to other researchers."
What should the DDA keep for a similar course in the future?,Yes!
What should the DDA keep for a similar course in the future?,Keep everything!
What should the DDA keep for a similar course in the future?,Group work (with possibly some extra time)
What should the DDA keep for a similar course in the future?,I think the course was well organized and thought out.
What should the DDA keep for a similar course in the future?,a continous advanced course
What should the DDA keep for a similar course in the future?,I think the course was great!
What should the DDA keep for a similar course in the future?,The code along followed by group work worked really well.
What should the DDA keep for a similar course in the future?,Everything was good
What should the DDA keep for a similar course in the future?,"I think that it was important to have some lecture components about the reproducibility crisis and Open Science problems, so that we could have a context for why we should be incorporating R in our standard practice. I liked the code along and the helpers being able to provide on-the-spot assistance."
What could the DDA improve for a similar course in the future?,It wa a great course with all aspects.
What could the DDA improve for a similar course in the future?,To offer an intermedium course of R.
What could the DDA improve for a similar course in the future?,More code along and possibly more time for going further a Little more complicated tools (4 days course)
What could the DDA improve for a similar course in the future?,"To me it would had been good, if there were more time for the exercises, where we coded alone. Sometimes it went too fast with the exercises and I did not have the time to complete them all. But the exercises were very rewarding for me."
What could the DDA improve for a similar course in the future?,It's hard to say. It was a really great course
What could the DDA improve for a similar course in the future?,Potentially organise the group work so it can be created in a Markdown-final format from the beginning.
What could the DDA improve for a similar course in the future?,"The lectures about open science are interesting but I had a feeling that I could be working on learning R instead. I know it's super important, but I was focused on another subject. I would have liked a bit of a faster pace and more explanation of why/how we could apply certain functions in our practice."
