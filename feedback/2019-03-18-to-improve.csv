"From the last two days, what do you feel or think could have been improved or been better?"
"This time the work load was a bit smaller, and it was good to have some time for group work as well. Github session could have been useful to go through again (because repetition is a way to learn) once more during these 2 days). Otherwise (Y)!"
amazingly improved
group work was good to solidify the knowledge. I think a bit more on the itineration and function part with some time to practise could have been nice
"Maybe a few exercises. I really enjoy the code along, but I process more and get a better understanding when there are supplementary exercises to the code along."
"That we are rushing in the end to make the train, even though I have been one of those."
We should have used GIT in our assignment.
Adding one small section on how to use statistics in R.
"It would have been useful, if we would have time to solve and revise the exercises after the different sessions."
- group work could have been started alongside with lectures a bit earlier to really have the chance to sit together during lecture and discuss on hand
"more exercises, were you have to invent codes, not just 'code-along'"
I think we had too much time during class to do the assignment. My group was not aware that we had so much time and we had prepared from home an finished quite early. I would have been nice with some information about how much time we had in class.
"I improved my general knowledge in relation to R language. Further, I got a very good hands-on training on how to use R markdown. thank you very much"
Nice presentation and nicely structured.
More support or explanation on the use of Github and Git
upload course material a bit earlier
I think it was really good. Dont have anything right now.
Regarding the group work: help to setup GitHub for the group.
Short breaks more often . Standing tables available like the one where the computer was connected . Open the doors every now and then
"I honestly don't have anything to add, I think the balance between lectures and exercises has been great, as the combination. We have touched upon different 'open' things and give good guidelines for new people coming to the field to use"
"That we are always rushing in the end to make the train, even though I've been one of those"
It would have been useful if we would have time to solve ad revise the exercises after the different sessions
Presentation of the material and slides have been improved.
