Amazing work making R accessible for beginners. Thanks for the course :)
Was a great course! :) Suggestion could be to include some additional material/exercises for researchers that are a bit more experienced
I want to thank DDA and the instructors for offering such a great course. Looking forward to participate in intermediate course.
"Better time management. Otherwise, great job! And thank you!"
"Please, remember to put ""Energizers"" in to the program. We are sitting a lot with one-way-communication."
a minor comment but may be the tables and chairs height could be adjusted
The course was recommended by my officemate who participated in last year and I also will highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in using R and does not have that much knowledge on it like me :)
Can we make it 4 days!! :D
"The instrcutors are amazing, very patient and cheerful to us. I hope in the follow up intermediate class we will learn more on the packages for, genome alignment, and more case studies and exercise for coding muscle traininng. Thank you all."
