"It was good order with going throught the things, good and relevant lectures and good amount of exercises. It was also good to have these kind helping hands here to help us individually. Maybe one extra day would be nice for the first session!"
The dynamic of the course organizers and assistants was well coordinated.
I am very excited by learning the basic R program taught by Luke and how to make open data of papers by Daniel.
"The structure of the course is quite good, which fits the need of researchers."
"The project structure was excellent, I would like a stronger focus on git/github and maybe separate the R basics such as wrangling/data visulaisation from the rest of the things"
"It is super to have the github website with EVERYTHING on it. I think it works very well with the write along sessions. Also that the exercises are not too long, so the momentum keeps going. The walkthrough of different websites was a bit long."
"Everything is very easily and well explained.
The exercises are fun, and I learn a lot from them - more of those please"
the code-alongs have been great to see what you van do with what kind of data and why. Problem solving has been great!
"I liked the sticky note method, gives others time to catch up and the faster learners a chance to keep moving. I also like the course material and how the codes were made available in case you get stuck. Also, the use of simple datasets like NHANES."
"- patient instructors
- the website with a lot of good examples and ressources"
"code-alongs were very useful (bit fast sometimes), would also like to have covered more about creating own functions, programming (loops)"
The lectures were really nice to get other people input and view on the reproducible science. I would wish the focus was shifted more towards that debate than actually during the coding. But overall nice course.
"I liked the hands on programming part, that worked well and I would like to have more of that."
The code-along worked really well. It was nice that you could get help quickly and easily
Doing more Exercises to practice individually
I think the balance between
The live demonstration is really nice. Also the lecture on open science and reproducibility is a breath of fresh air. Most of people are scared to talk about the elephant in the room.
"- worked well with real work examples, working with NHANES
- liked that you refered to published articles that did sth good
- the github was a bit tough to learn, perhaps it would have been good for participants to receive a bit material beforehand"
"I liked the ""coding-along"", learned a lot, would have liked more exircses."
"The coding along was very good. And it has been great that there has been so many helpers. Good with both lecturers and coding along and good to refresh what was thaught the day before. Very cool that everything is on the homepage, then we can practi"
"more practical excercises but please slow down a little as you are so fast writting the codes. Further, please adjust the light - I could not see all the text. Thanks"
Very structured course. the website with all the course material is fabulous. I the beginning of the course it would have been nice just with a 2 minuets explanation of the windows in R. Great venue. Great food. Good instructors.
