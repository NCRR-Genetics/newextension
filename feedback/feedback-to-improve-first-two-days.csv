"Maybe had one extra day at this first session, just to have a bit more brakes and a bit more time to sink in the learned things. Otherwise, very very nice first session with interesting and interactive way to teach!"
I think overall it was a great course this far. I would like better guidance during the Git hands on session. Thanks!
excellent
"Very helpful. I learned a lot. For the version control section, please slow down a bit."
"the tidyverse section, dedicated session before to set up git and R studio / R
tiny amount of unix for Terminal as an extra lecture"
"Great course! There is a good balance between lectures and exercises. Sometimes write along goes a bit fast, but you are quick to go back when asked.
A few 5min breaks during the second day could have been nice to stretch legs and get hydrated."
"Sometimes it runs too fast for me, but it is also understandable why we have to move on.
Otherwise amazing course!"
Git is very difficult to grasp quickly and I would need more time to get the hang of it. What to when and why. And how to apply it into my version control. Still difficult: is it only for code or also for text?
"Really great course.
Maybe have more time for exercises."
- I could have been more prepared with having R and git up and running before the course. Suggest we somehow test on advance.
great course - need to adjust program in future to ensure all topics are sufficiently covered. Would be nice also cover merging large datasets
"More structure from the instructor, especially during the git session where it seemed at bit spontaneous."
More time for the hands on data analysis/problem solving would have been nicer.
The git part was very difficult and it was not easy to understand why we should do it
sometimes hard to follow why we are using specific codes and what is the meaning
"I am not sure, but I enjoyed that we went directly to the ""things"" from R that we are probably going to use instead of going around with a lot of options that we probably won't use. Git was maybe a bit too advanced"
Have a smaller group size and make it compulsory to install the latest version of software in their computer in advance.
"- Big kudos for mix of lecture + hands-on, its really great to learn how to do the things practically
- really nice to have the helpers 
- sometimes we could have continued a bit faster perhaps (there was a lot of time for all to catch up)"
"everything is new to me, so I learned a lot"
Git was difficult. I think we either should use more time on it or skip it.
"I like the course so far. Yet, next time, try to send the material ahead of the course so participants (who have time) can prepare - especially if a participant have no idea about R or the course theme"
"This is a very good course, easy to follow along and nicely structures. R is intuitive. I would have preferred more smaller breaks as some of the sessions are very long and it is hard to focus for long time. Nice venue. Nice food"
