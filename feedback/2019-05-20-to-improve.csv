"Over the three days, what do you feel or think could have been improved or been better? Please add as many comments as you want!!:"
I would love to have more days to be able to go through the material slowly
"A short introduction into R for those who have never used it before would be great. For example: What can I use it for (not only for programming but also for statistics...)
More time for explanations would be great, like ""what does this command do""."
it might better if people have at least some experience in R or other programming languages
"Very nice workshop. Very enthusiastic and pedagogue teacher. Very inspiring.
Maybe too short."
It was really noticeable how our skills improved over these three days. All the exercises were very useful and made it possible to develop a routine and habits that make writing code easier.
"The workshop was very nice! The only session, that was not completely well structured, was the session about Git. You could explain a little more about the basic principles and how it works before doing examples in R."
Some explanations of the reason for writing some words or code were going too fast for me
"The Course was great, day 1 felt a bit premature, I would maybe shift days 1 and 2 with one another."
"While the overall program outline was very nice and included the parts of R I expected, parts of it were quite ambitious for such a tiny amount of time (especially the efficient coding section, which is difficult to get for people w/o code training)"
"The exercises format could be improve. Right now, we had some trivial problems that we all were doing together (including Luke) and then, say, bigger problems. Would be better, if we did small exercises on our own and then took on the bigger prob"
"Some concepts of the last day were somewhat abstract for people who never heard of it (functions and map), so maybe it would be nice to have some more time to understand the principles of that
Some exercises were a bit tricky"
"It could be better to provide two versions of the course:
1. for absolute beginners 
2. for people who have some experience in ""statistical programming"", e.g. in SAS"
Ignoring time restrictions: Would have been very nice to discuss some of the real data that people work with
sometimes it was hard to follow and to really understand everything because I was not fast enough in writing the code. so I just copied it from the material. So there should be some more time to write the code and understand what you actually write.
"Learned what R can do - a lot. The course material is easy to follow and was presented in a clear and concise way. Some parts of the course was too fast, which led to being lost."
"longer introduction in programming language/R (general possibilities, options, packages etc.), at least if course is also announced for people without any experience"
"The only bit, during which I was missing a bit of context, was during the Git Session. I was able to follow all the steps, but I didn't really understand what I was doing there, so it might be hard for me to apply this later on"
"The course might be split into two courses, one for coding beginners and one for those with a bit of coding/R experience"
Eventually offer to briefly talk through the exercises after completion (if there is interest)
"It may be important to recommend for ""absolute beginners"" to read course materials BEFORE each course day, to that formulas and general idea are more familiar"
For the GIT session: I believe a short abstract introduction about how GIT organizes information (kind of what you did at the blackboard in betwee) would help in the beginning!
But over all really good course and would recommend it to anyone.
"ggplot2 session is always the most impressive one; maybe include a bit more time/space to play around rather than let people try to get close to the ""originals"" -providing cheatsheets or similar would be nice. Also then people could show plots/discus"
Can we get a list of your top 10 or 20 (or whatever number you feel is appropriate) r-packages and what you use them for - as kind of a summary that we can look uo regularly
More small exercises with more interaction could be rewarding
"Large exercises at the end are nice, but taking a lot of time, also very differently between people, maybe encourage the experienced/early finishers more to help slower people"
"A small session of how to translate internet resources (cheat sheets, blogs, demistifiers) on R could be rewarding"
"Maybe a online ""pre-test"" for people who don't know if they qualify for the intensity of the course would help to let them know if the class suits them - though don't be exclusive (difficult one)"
