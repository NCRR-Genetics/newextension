Day 1,Management of R projects,The  notes for what was being done,perhaps begin with where to work with R code rather then  github
Day 1,Management of R projects,"Nice interaction between slide set, text guide and tasks.",Nothing to add.
Day 1,Management of R projects,Slow and steady teaching. Great help.,More time for hands on. More practice.
Day 1,Management of R projects,Code-along worked very well.,"Maybe you could add a bit more too how to do ""neat"" coding."
Day 1,Management of R projects,"The ""code along""/""watch while we go through""-approach","If you insist on introducing vectors, naming and syntax at this point, maybe you could tell a little more about what it is used for"
Day 1,Management of R projects,Connecting the Rstudio to the Github,all is fine
Day 1,Management of R projects,Made my first R project.,Could probably go quicker through this section.

Day 1,Management of R projects,Exercises on code language were useful,maybe some more functions with their application? Although I know there is not a lot of time. Maybe just having them on the book but not go through them.
Day 1,Management of R projects,The code-along was very useful. I would not have done it without this type of supervision. But I was copy-pasting most of the time without knowing what I was doing. But the exercises helped a lot. Soufyan did a great job explaining everything.,"Sometimes it went too fast. and at some point the helpers were talking too loud, so it was difficult to hear the presenter. It was very distracting. I suggest that either the helpers whisper while the presenter continues the session, or the presenter waits for everyone to be ready before continuing."
Day 1,Management of R projects,The practical code-along and step-by-step of common mistakes and pitfalls,"It was overall a good session, and potentially a more relevant example would be nice to have"
Day 1,Management of R projects,This part for me worked well.,This part for me worked well.
Day 1,Management of R projects,Code along,"Start a bit more basic (e.g., use of #, what are packages, load packages and use functions) and mention when it can look differently on your screen)"
Day 1,Management of R projects,"I learned how to make an R project and how files can be stored together in a meaningful way, which is very useful",Have more small exercises like the one where you have to edit code and such - maybe just as extra optional activities
Day 1,Management of R projects,"code-along, the blue and orange post-its, the tempo (I could follow)",?
Day 1,Management of R projects,"Code along worked well, also the simple steps were easy to follow.",The session worked well in general and was a good foundation for a beginner.
Day 1,Management of R projects,The session was comprehensible because of the code-along and practical exercises,It could be even more applied if we used a fictive research project and build it up in R
Day 1,Management of R projects,hands on workshop is very designed,more case studies

Day 1,Version control and collaborative practices,It was easy to understand what is means,"Git is a bit complicated to understand, but I guess it will get better tomorrow :)"
Day 1,Version control and collaborative practices,Good pace so that you do not get lost,"sorry, I have no concrete improvements"
Day 1,Version control and collaborative practices,The syllabus material,I'm having troubles understanding how this will fit in with my daily work. I feel it is a bit yo much. I don't really understand R yet
Day 1,Version control and collaborative practices,"It actually was not my main interest to join this course (maybe will be on later stage), but I clearly can see the advantages",None
Day 1,Version control and collaborative practices,Clear description,"It is not necessary to include ""what do we think is difficult in our collaboration now""."
Day 1,Version control and collaborative practices,"Didnt know you could do this, so really helpful and I would never had figured it out on my own.",Difficult to have a clear perception/flow/concentration because there was many interruptions (mainly due towindows/mac differences)
Day 1,Version control and collaborative practices,I found the intro to git really comprehensive and I liked to see the examples on version control provided,I think we could have used a bit more time exploring the github website. I understand it is difficult to include everything into only one session though.

Day 1,Version control and collaborative practices,Having to read some of the first parts as part of the pre-course and the explanation of what it is and why we should do it. The slow approach to how to commit files was generally easy to follow,"Going thru at least 2 different ways of working with the repositories might be useful to know, rather than being dependent on a single method?"
Day 1,Version control and collaborative practices,The theoretical explanation about Git and why worth to learn it worked super well.,"I got confused during the practice because there are several ways to execute the commands, and maybe if explain separated could be better to understand how Github connects to Rstudio."
Day 1,Version control and collaborative practices,"Short exercises and discussions, hands-on training, quick support","Reading material was sometimes difficult to understand - was much clearer after the comments of the lecturers, so maybe this can be more combined?"
Day 1,Version control and collaborative practices,Good introduction to what git is and why you should use it,Add the alternative way of pushing repositories to github to the course site
Day 1,Version control and collaborative practices,Same as above. It worked well with the fast help from instructors. If you get behind it is difficult to catch up.,?
Day 1,Version control and collaborative practices,Git was a completely new concept for me but it was still possible to follow along.,Could have included more real life examples to understand what could it be actually used for in research.
Day 1,Version control and collaborative practices,"Again, the hands-on exercises helped to build an understanding on how to communicate in Git and GitHub",It could also be more applied if we used a fictive case
Day 1,Version control and collaborative practices,nothing specific,nothing specific

Day 2,Creating reproducible documents,Nothing worked! I was not able to knit to HTML due to computer problems,See previous answer
Day 2,Creating reproducible documents,Creating/setting up R markdown files,All is fine
Day 2,Creating reproducible documents,Really got to se the magic of R,I unfortunately have no ideas for improvement.
Day 2,Creating reproducible documents,the detailed notes were very helpful,it might be helpful to ask the students to do an excercise similar to the wrangling session
Day 2,Creating reproducible documents,That was fun :) as long as you can see your rewards (visible rewards :) ) you feel good!,None
Day 2,Creating reproducible documents,Using the tables 'we' made and seeing how we can apply them to our own writing etc,"More information on font changes, table formatting, and whether referencing softwares can be included"
Day 2,Creating reproducible documents,Good introduction to what a markdown file is and how to use it,Don't know
Day 2,Creating reproducible documents,"It was really neat to learn about creating word and html documents, which we are used to working with in other circumstances.","I think the session was fairly brief, but I understand you don't have time to show a lot."
Day 2,Creating reproducible documents,It was fun and helpful. I had a great time. R is amazing.,no comment.
Day 2,Creating reproducible documents,"I think it worked well. Too little time for R Markdown, but I think we will use more time tomorrow.",Maybe include a small walk (e.g. including some discussion points) in the afternoon of day 2.
Day 2,Creating reproducible documents,"I enjoyed learning about R markdown, it looks really exciting for data sharing.","I'm guessing we will learn more about Rmarkdown during the 3rd day, I felt that we just scrtched the surface of it today."
Day 2,Creating reproducible documents,"This section was great since we could get an overview about the importance to share our work with scientific and non-scientific community, giving us a wide understand about the importance of science for society.",I do not have additional comments for this section.

Day 2,Data management and wrangling,all was great,all was great
Day 2,Data management and wrangling,it was good,all computers needs to work beforehand
Day 2,Data management and wrangling,Code along was good.,Could be nice to tidy a messy data set as exercise.
Day 2,Data management and wrangling,It is super usefull information and code that we will probably use in the future,It was a long time and a bit slow
Day 2,Data management and wrangling,The text explained the function very well.,Try to not only made one-way-communication for learning. Some could be done in groups etc. Include some small energiser etc.
Day 2,Data management and wrangling,"Hands-on training, trying out different functions",Maybe provide extra exercises if people are waiting for the group
Day 2,Data management and wrangling,It was nice structured with the possibility to code along and have a basic understanding of piping and basic dplyr functions,"It is always difficult with different prerequisites, but I could use more (and a little more complex) exercises"
Day 2,Data management and wrangling,Proposed work plan was logically organized.,Better speaker preparation. Better time management. The most challenging part of the session was compromised because of speaker's poor management of the session. Learning was compromised.
Day 2,Data management and wrangling,The ode-along was very nice and comprehensible,I missed a code to cross check the new variables and the restrictions that were made along the way (e.g. like codebook in Stata)
Day 2,Data management and wrangling,Learning about Git and Github,More time specified for this part may improve it more.
Day 2,Data management and wrangling,"I love code-along. Good pace so that you can keep up when you first start to get familiar with R. Really liked the use of real data, to better understand.",I unfortunately have no ideas for improvement.
Day 2,Data management and wrangling,the detailed notes and the  work along session was very helpful to grasp the topic.,there probably isn't time for it but perhaps more excercises will help to commit the method to memory
Day 2,Data management and wrangling,All coding sessions went pretty well and I enjoyed all day :),"I would like to recommend to include some time to show how to import our own data sets. Most of the day we were working on an available dataset (I assume ""nhanes"") which might be better if we could learn how to import for example an Excel or csv datafile"
Day 2,Data management and wrangling,"Slow explanation of what each function does, how you can use them, and the process of saving the files etc",Potentially include common mistakes and pitfalls when managing big data?
Day 2,Data management and wrangling,really nice with the code along to learn some of the basic data wrangling,Don't know
Day 2,Data management and wrangling,It was really nice to start learning and playing around with some basic coding in R,I think the practical application of each step could be described a bit better. E.g. in what situations would each step be applicable
Day 2,Data management and wrangling,It was very helpful to go through the text and do code-along. I enjoyed it and learned alot.,There is too much noise when the helpers try to help people. distracting.
Day 2,Data management and wrangling,"Code along, introduction to basic codes, nice that we have to use parts of what we learned yesterday",?
Day 2,Data management and wrangling,"I found this session useful, we learned many different actions from dplyr to manage and edit our data, which I personally think is very important, as every package or script you find online will ask you to have your data formatted in a certain way.",No comments from my side
Day 2,Data management and wrangling,This section worked very well since I could understand and reinforce the topics that I learned in the day before.,A lot of new things to learn in a short period of time. Maybe more time dedicated for this section should work better at least for me.
Day 2,Data management and wrangling,It was a good session overall.,"Not sure if it could have been added to this part of the course, but while mentioning about the data/tables/table names, it could have been ideal to openly mention what is ethically correct to call the variables. There are many papers still using ""gender"", ""caucasian"", presenting % of males only etc. and it is so commonly used that junior researcher think this is the correct way to do it, and often times senior researcher are not even aware."
Day 2,lecture presentations,Nice perspectives,a bit long
Day 2,lecture presentations,nice struture,nothing specific
Day 2,lecture presentations,"Questions, interactive.",Nothing
Day 2,lecture presentations,good,a bit more interaction
Day 2,lecture presentations,group discussion,nothing
Day 2,lecture presentations,perfect,nothing special
Day 2,lecture presentations,Standing up,???
Day 2,lecture presentations,Good to stand up and do some thinking,Nothing
Day 2,lecture presentations,Good way of changing the pace and cleaning our mind a bit.,Maybe add some practical examples.
Day 2,lecture presentations,Not relevant,not relevant
Day 2,lecture presentations,Standing during the lecture,Maybe give a bit more time to discuss ideas after exercises
Day 2,lecture presentations,*,*
Day 2,lecture presentations,Dynamics,We were too tired to enjoy it.
Day 2,lecture presentations,It works very well when we stand up. It makes the presentation more lively and the audience more engaged,NA
Day 2,lecture presentations,Group discussion,improved
Day 2,lecture presentations,"Really liked getting perspectives on something we often don't question in our daily life, but we really need ti.",I unfortunately have no ideas for improvement.
Day 2,lecture presentations,The interactive approach was very valuable,I am happy with how the lectures were spread out.
Day 2,lecture presentations,I enjoyed all the presentation sessions.,It would be nice if time to time you encourage participants to do a physical activity such as standing up and have a 2-3 minutes short discussion about the relevant topics.
Day 2,lecture presentations,The interactive style and that it was a two-way street,"Ironically, being able to see the slides would have been nice to follow and read some of the points and words being made"
Day 2,lecture presentations,"Nice with the informal setting with  standing, also to change position from sitting all day",More discussions potentially
Day 2,lecture presentations,"Very clear, step by step presentations",Maybe show some examples of things created in R and R markdown?
Day 2,lecture presentations,I loved the fact that we are called out to move around in the room. stand up in the group and take part in the discussions. Luke's passion is contagious!,"The slides might a go a bit fast, so I don't get the time to read the. But Luke is very good at explaining and presenting, so I don't feel like missing out on anything :)"
Day 2,lecture presentations,Reflections on our own practice. Nice that we could stand up for a while.,?
Day 2,lecture presentations,"It was really inspiring, I enjoyed the lecture","No comments, it was a great talk"
Day 2,lecture presentations,This section worked very well for me but I would like to have more time dedicated for this section.,I think that real examples of how R Markdown could be used in order to illustrate better the functionalities.
Day 2,lecture presentations,"Really important aspects of major academic problems were mentioned, it was great to think about the reality and practically and discuss what to do. These are the things usually are not discussed but quite fundamental.",Maybe some real life examples.
Day 3,Data visualization,everything,nothing
Day 3,Data visualization,nice content and examples,too short
Day 3,Data visualization,It was very nice to get to try out different ways of visualizing the data. It was good that we spent a lot of time on this and was shown many ways to alter and play around with the figures.,I don't know.
Day 3,Data visualization,"I found this section one of the most useful for my research, since I often need to probe 'omics data in many different ways. It was fairly detailed, showing types of data/graphs, themes, customisation etc.",Even more time spent here! More customisation of specific figures!
Day 3,Data visualization,"Rally nice to create different types of graphs, and to talk about some dos and dont's when making figures.",nothing
Day 3,Data visualization,It was super interesting and usefull.,More time to try to create and change graphs.
Day 3,Data visualization,code along was nice,I don't know
Day 3,Data visualization,graphs,was great
Day 3,Data visualization,"Being shown the different ways to plot the data, and number of variables we can/should include","Whilst I understand that it should be towards the end of the course, with all the basics being taught prior, it might be nice to have more emphasise on them as it is one of the most important aspect/reason for attending the R course"
Day 3,Data visualization,Examples of various types of data,x
Day 3,Data visualization,"Creating tables, graphs using ggplot and all that was taught in the class",Improved
Day 3,Data visualization,"Once again, the code-along approach","Nothing really, it could be longer. Maybe you could add some examples of ""how you we (as teachers) use RStudio in our workflow"". E.g. when do you code in your script-file and when do you ""try it out"" in your markdown file and see the outputs. Do you do a lot of switching back and forth or do you finish the entire code before using markdown."
Day 3,Data visualization,Very nice interaction and organization.,Nothing to add.
Day 3,Data visualization,Graphs look nice. Very good text and description on the webside.,"Remember to show how to put names at X and Y axis. That is important for ""nice"" graphs."
Day 3,Data visualization,working along with the instructorwas helpful and that let me build a final cheet sheet of my own,May be a bit more time in coding along would have been helpful
Day 3,Data visualization,"It was a great session, usually I have found pieces of code in google to plot some data and I never completely understood what aes or geom meant. With today's session I learned how to effectively use ggplot :)","I don't have any complains, I found it really useful"
Day 3,Data visualization,Data visualation did go pretty well. I enjoyed almost all part of it due to the need that I will have to this part in my career.,"Including more analysis for principle component analysis (PCA), PLS-DA, Heatmap analysis and etc, might improve it."
Day 3,Data visualization,"The tempo was great, not too slow or too fast.",I cant think of anything to be improved  besides mayby  the excercise 8.5 was too easy when we could copy most of the codes.
Day 3,Data visualization,"code along, different themes, touching different aspects of the ggplot2",even more aspects. Creating your own theme.
Day 3,Data visualization,It was the most fun and relateable session. Luke did a great job. Many times during this session I thought: this is the best course ever!,This session should last longer! :D
Day 3,Data visualization,The examples used were easy to understand and follow the codes.,Maybe dedicate more time working on this topic.
Day 3,Data visualization,Very nice that you go through so many different types of graphs and how you build the layers with ggplot,It was a shame that we were behind schedule so some of the session was a bit rushed
Day 3,Data visualization,Really good to try different types of plots and get a quick overview.,All was good.
Day 3,Data visualization,The code-along,a bit more time to do the exercises
Day 3,Data visualization,clear tutoring session,more hands coding exercises
Day 3,group project assignment,the group discussion and brainstorming and having one member to code and others to google or search from the reading materials,the data sheet was confusing
Day 3,group project assignment,interaction,short time
Day 3,group project assignment,I think it was a good assignment and good opportunity to practice and apply what we've learnt.,"Hmm, I think it's good as it is."
Day 3,group project assignment,"Giving us the opportunity to go from beginning to end. Practice collaborating, merging the docs and actively engaging with GitHub.",Maybe a little bit more time to have something more detailed and logical.
Day 3,group project assignment,good to try to stand on your own feet,"Maybe provide a smaller and more tidy dataset, so we don't use a lot of time on this (we can do that at home)"
Day 3,group project assignment,We could help each other out.,More clear instructions and suggest to follow the steps that are in the book from the beggining.
Day 3,group project assignment,Trying out what we have learned on a dataset,Making the repository on Github ourselves
Day 3,group project assignment,practice visualising a dataset and see the result of collaboration in R,was great
Day 3,group project assignment,"Having an instructor attached to the group, and having someone to discuss things with",NA
Day 3,group project assignment,Experimenting with R and Git,Get a bit more time to finish the final report
Day 3,group project assignment,"Distributing tasks, Merging the R markdown file and pulling and pushing files into and from Git.",Improved
Day 3,group project assignment,It was nice trying to do it yourself.,A little more time.
Day 3,group project assignment,"Instructions were very clear, support was provided when necessary.",Pre-establishing what files and tasks should be performed. Creativity takes time and that is out of course focus.
Day 3,group project assignment,"Nice with group work! Very useful, because you discuss things","The start procedure. Maybe it could be describe a little better. Maybe made an easier dataset, so you don not waist time to understand it."
Day 3,group project assignment,The guidance from the  instructors was good,I think it will be helpful to carry out teh donwlaoding of the data part the day before so  the teams have time to look over the data and spend more time today on working
Day 3,group project assignment,I think it was the most important part of the course. It was great to put everything we learned to test. I really enjoyed it.,"I only think that 30 more minutes of project could have benefit most of the projects, but i also understand that the point of the session is just to check if our documents were reproducible"
Day 3,group project assignment,"That was also very good, I could also learn things from my groupmates",None
Day 3,group project assignment,Trying to do everything from scratch. Would maybe be fun to start up on day 2 setting up the markdowm and looking at the data etc for an hour and the day 3 we make the asignment.,Would maybe be fun to start up on day 2 setting up the markdowm and looking at the data etc for an hour and the day 3 we make the asignment.
Day 3,group project assignment,working in a group was nice and seeing the power of github.,The data cleaning requires more experience before we are able to clean it properly and also more time to be familiar with the data. We were a bit confused when the instructors did not follow what was written on the website.
Day 3,group project assignment,It was great opportunity to talk with the rest of the group and get an idea of how much people have learned from the course. It was an amazing and inspiring experience.,I think everyone should do all the steps. I felt lost many times during the first part when we had to download the package. But overall very great.
Day 3,group project assignment,High quality of reading material.,Not to much time to accomplish the activity.
Day 3,group project assignment,"Nice to get some data to work with yourself, so you can an idea of the problems you will encounter when working with your own data","Maybe a little too short time so get much done, since it can take some time just to figure out what to do with data - maybe half an hour could be allocated on day 1 and 2, just to get familiar with the data in a way that corresponds to what you've learned that day."
Day 3,group project assignment,To have a group assignment at the end of the course was good.,We quickly choose the zika dataset and later realized that it was a mistake. The options in the dataset were limited and we spent too much time on deciding the potential plot/table we want to go for. Trying to reproduce data from published papers with simple analyses could be tested also.
Day 3,group project assignment,A good idea to finish the course with hands-on assignments,Either the assignment was to vague and undefined or we had to little time and to little supervision.
Day 3,group project assignment,great to share and work together,longer time
