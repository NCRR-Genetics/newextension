### Expected learning

For the final exercise of this session, you will try to get the data from the
original data (using NHANES) to the table below. By using the code in this
session, you will have acheived our learning expectations.

The final exercise will be to get this data:

```{r nhanes-data}
NHANES
```

To look like this:

```{r nhanes-output, echo=FALSE}
NHANES %>% 
    mutate(MoreThan5DaysActive = if_else(PhysActiveDays >= 5, TRUE, FALSE)) %>% 
    select(SurveyYr, Gender, Age, Poverty, BMI, BPSysAve, BPDiaAve, TotChol,
           DiabetesAge, nBabies, MoreThan5DaysActive, AlcoholDay) %>% 
    rename(TotalCholesterol = TotChol, 
           NumberOfBabies = nBabies, 
           DrinksOfAlcoholInDay = AlcoholDay, 
           AgeDiabetesDiagnosis = DiabetesAge) %>% 
    filter(Age >= 18, Age <= 75) %>% 
    gather(Measure, Value, -SurveyYr, -Gender) %>% 
    group_by(SurveyYr, Gender, Measure) %>% 
    summarise(Mean = round(mean(Value, na.rm = TRUE), 2)) %>% 
    arrange(Measure, Gender, SurveyYr) %>% 
    spread(SurveyYr, Mean) %>% 
    kable(caption = "Mean values of characteristics for women and men between 18-75 years of age at each of the two survey years.")
```

## Managing and working with data in R

Recall that:

- You should **never** edit your raw data (should be in `data-raw/` folder)
- Only work with your raw data using R code 
- Save the edited data as another dataset (should be in `data/` folder)
- Document and comment as best you can to help you remember
    - But, let the code speak for itself (e.g. keep it simple, have intermediate and descriptive steps)
    
In data "wrangling"/"munging"/managing, most tasks can be broken down into only
a few simple "verbs" (actions), as listed in the table.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tibble::tribble(
    ~Tasks, ~Examples, ~Function,
    "Choosing columns", "Remove columns related to data entry, such as name of person entering data.", "select()",
    "Renaming columns", "Changing a column name from 'Q1' to 'ParticipantName'.", "rename()",
    "Transforming or modifying columns", "Multiplying a column's values; taking the log.", "mutate()",
    "Subsetting/filtering out rows/observations", "Keeping rows with glucose values above 4.", "filter()",
    "Sorting/re-arranging rows", "Show rows with the smallest value at the top.", "arrange()",
    "Converting from wide to long form", "One row per participant to multiple participants per row (repeated measures).", "gather()",
    "Converting from long to wide form", "Multiple rows per participant (repeated measures) to one participant per row.", "spread()",
    "Calculating summaries on the data", "Calculating the maximum, median, and minimum age.", "summarise()",
    "Running analyses by group", "Calculate means of age by males and females.", "group_by() with summarise()"
) %>% 
    kable(caption = "Data wrangling task, an example of the task, and the functions to use for data wrangling.")
```

Wrangling here is used in the sense of maneuvering, managing, controlling, and
turning your data around to better understand it and to prepare it for later
analyses. The packages dplyr and tidyr provide easy tools for most common data
manipulation tasks. For dplyr, it is built to work directly with data frames and
has an additional feature to interact directly with data stored in an external
database, such as in SQL. Working with databases is powerful as you can work
with massive datasets (100s of GB), more than your computer could normally
handle. This won't be covered, but see this [resources from Data
Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/05-r-and-databases.html))
to learn more.

A **tip** when doing complicated wrangling and you get the data to a form that you
like and will use often: Save it as an "output" dataset in the `data/` folder so
you can easily use it again later rather than run the wrangling code everytime.

## Loading the packages and dataset

We're going to use the US [NHANES] dataset. There is an [NHANES package] that
contains a teaching version of the original dataset, so we'll use that for this
lesson. First, make sure the R Project you created previously is open. Then open
the `R/wrangling-session.R` script to start typing out the next code. We'll use
this file to write the code for this session (but not for the exercises).

[NHANES]: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm
[NHANES package]: https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=NHANES

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load up the packages
# tidyverse contains the dplyr and tidyr packages
library(tidyverse)
library(NHANES)

# Briefly glimpse contents of dataset
glimpse(NHANES)
```

### Exercise: Become familiar with the dataset

Time: 10 min

Take the time to get familiar with the NHANES dataset. Create a new R script
by typing in the console `usethis::use_r("exercises-wrangling")`. Then copy the
code below into the file and replace the `___` with the `NHANES` dataset. Run
each line of code by typing `Ctrl-Enter`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Load the packages
library(tidyverse)
library(NHANES)

# Check column names
colnames(___)

# Look at contents
str(___)
glimpse(___)

# See summary
summary(___)

# Look over the dataset documentation
?___
```

## "Messy" vs. "tidy" data

The concept of "tidy" data was popularized in an [article] by Hadley Wickham
and described more in the [Tidy Data chapter] of the R for Data Science online
book. A tidy dataset is when:

- Each variable has its own column.
- Each observation has its own row
- Each value has its own cell

[article]: http://www.jstatsoft.org/v59/i10/paper.

Looking at these example datasets, think about why each is "tidy" or "messy". 
What do you notice between the tidy versions and the messier versions?

```{r}
# Datasets come from tidyr
# Tidy:
table1
# Tidy:
table2
# Messier:
table3
# Messy:
table4a
# Messy:
table4b
```

In the tidy versions, `table1` and `table2` have columns that describe their values
(e.g. population is population size), each row is unique (e.g. first row is for 
values from Afghanistan from 1999), and each cell is an explicit value
representative of its column and row. On the other hand, `table3` is not tidy 
because the `rate` column values are a composite of two other column values
(cases and population), when it should be a single number (a percent). Both
`table4a` and `table4b` have columns with ambiguous values inside... what does
values in the `1999` column contain? You can't tell from the data.

Tidy data has a few notable benefits:

1. Time spent preparing your data to be tidy from the beginning can save days
of frustration in the long run.
2. "Tidy data" is a conceptual framework that allows you to easy build off and
wrangle data in simpler and easy to interpret ways, especially when using the
tidyverse packages.

From the concept of tidy data also comes the concept of tidy code. By using
"verbs" (R functions), chaining them together in "sentences" (in a sequential
pipeline), you can construct meaningful and readable code that, in more plain
English, describes what you are doing to the data.

## `%>%`: The pipe operator

A key component of the tidy data and tidy code concept is the use of the `%>%`
operator. This operator allows you to "pipe" the output from one function to the
input of another function, thus allowing you to easily chain functions together
into "sentences". So, instead of nesting functions (reading from the inside to
the outside), the idea of piping is to read the functions from left to right.
This can help clarify and break down complex data processing workflows.

```{r}
# These two ways are the same
colnames(NHANES)
NHANES %>% 
    colnames()

# Standard R way of "chaining" functions together
glimpse(head(NHANES))

# The pipe way of chaining
NHANES %>% 
    head() %>% 
    glimpse()
```

## `mutate()`: Transforming or adding variables

When you need to add a new column or modify an existing one, you can use the
`mutate()` function. Get it, mutate as in to change :wink:

```{r}
# Modify an existing variable
NHANES %>%
    mutate(Height = Height / 100)

# Or create a new variable based on a condition
NHANES %>%
    mutate(HighlyActive = if_else(PhysActiveDays >= 5, "yes", "no"))

# Create or replace multiple variables by using the ","
NHANES %>%
    mutate(new_column = "only one value",
           Height = Height / 100)

# Create new variable with existing variables and save the changes
NHANES_update <- NHANES %>%
    mutate(UrineVolAverage = (UrineVol1 + UrineVol2) / 2)
```

Use the table below as a reference for logical conditions you can use in the
`if_else` function.

```{r logic-operators, echo=FALSE}
tibble::tribble(
    ~Operator, ~ Description,
    "<", "less than",
    "<=", "less than or equal to",
    ">", "greater than",
    ">=", "greater than or equal to",
    "==", "equal to",
    "!=", "not equal to",
    "!x", "Not x",
    "x | y", "x OR y",
    "x & y", "x AND y"
) %>% 
    kable(caption = "Logical operators in R.")
```

### Exercise: Piping, transforming, and adding

Time: 10 min

Here's a chance to practise. Again, using the `exercises-wrangling.R` script in
the `R` folder, take the code below and replace the `___` with the appropriate
variable names. Complete the tasks below. (Suggestion: Create a new "Section"
in the script for this exercise via `Ctrl-Shift-R`).

1. Create a new variable called "UrineVolAverage" by calculating the average
urine volumne (from "UrineVol1" and "UrineVol2").
2. Modify/replace the "Pulse" variable to beats per second (currently is beats per minute).
3. Create a new variable called "YoungChild" when age is less than 6 years.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Check the names of the variables
colnames(NHANES)

# Pipe the data into mutate function and:
NHANES_modified <- ___ %>% # dataset
    mutate(
        # 1. Calculate average urine volume
        ___ = ___,
        # 2. Modify Pulse variable
        ___ = ___,
        # 3. Create YoungChild variable using a condition
        ___ = if_else(___, TRUE, FALSE)
    )
NHANES_modified
```

Notice something about the "UrineVolAverage" values?

<details><summary><strong>Click for the solution</strong></summary>
<p>

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Check the names of the variables
colnames(NHANES)

# Pipe the data into mutate function and:
NHANES_modified <- NHANES %>% # dataset
    mutate(
        # 1. Calculate average urine volume
        UrineVolAverage = (UrineVol1 + UrineVol2) / 2,
        # 2. Modify Pulse variable
        Pulse = Pulse / 60,
        # 3. Create YoungChild variable using a condition
        YoungChild = if_else(Age < 6, TRUE, FALSE)
    )
```

For the "UrineVolAverage" values, they are probably almost entirely `NA` (aka
missing). That's because `NA` values are infectious. See how "UrineVol2" has mostly
`NA` values too? When you calculate something that has `NA`, you get another `NA`.
This is something to be careful about. So always check your calculations!

## `select()`: Select specific data by the variables

Sometimes you only need certain variables from a dataset, not all of them. Or
maybe you want to remove certain ones or select variables that match a pattern.
This is when you use `select()`.

```{r}
# Select columns/variables by name, without quotes
NHANES %>%
    select(Age, Gender, BMI)

# To *not* select a variable, us minus (-)
NHANES %>%
    select(-HeadCirc)

# When you have many variables with similar names, use "matching" functions
NHANES %>%
    select(starts_with("BP"), contains("Vol"))
```

For more information on using the pattern functions such as `starts_with()`,
check `?select_helpers`. If you are familiar with [regular expressions], you can
use `matches()`.

[regular expressions]: https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RegExCheatsheet.pdf

## `rename()`: Rename specific columns

If you need to rename a column, that's super easy! Use the `rename()` function!

```{r}
# rename using the form "newname = oldname"
NHANES %>% 
    rename(NumberBabies = nBabies)
```

## `filter()`: Filtering/subsetting the data by row

Subsetting/filtering data is a very common activity in data analysis, for example,
keeping only those older than 30 years. Using the `filter()` function lets you
do this. Filtering uses logic for conditions, so refer to the table above for the
logic operators.

**A warning**: Filtering using logic. Humans are really bad at logic. Make sure
that you are very certain that what you think your logic is doing is what the
code is actually doing. Confirm the findings! Lots of mistakes can be made at
this stage, especially with complex logic conditions and filtering. 

```{r}
# when gender is equal to
NHANES %>%
    filter(Gender == "female")

# when gender is *not* equal to
NHANES %>%
    filter(Gender != "female")

# when BMI is equal to
NHANES %>%
    filter(BMI == 25)

# when BMI is equal to or more than
NHANES %>%
    filter(BMI >= 25)

# when BMI is 25 *and* Gender is female
NHANES %>%
    filter(BMI == 25 & Gender == "female")

# when BMI is 25 *or* gender is female
NHANES %>%
    filter(BMI == 25 | Gender == "female")
```

## `arrange()`: Sorting/(re)arranging your data by column

Arranging/sorting your rows is fairly simple with dplyr. Just use `arrange()`!

```{r}
# ascending order by age
NHANES %>%
    arrange(Age) %>% 
    select(Age)

# Other arrange (for reference)
# descending order by rate
NHANES %>%
    arrange(desc(Age)) %>% 
    select(Age)

# ascending order by Age and Gender
NHANES %>%
    arrange(Age, Gender) %>% 
    select(Age, Gender)
```

### Exercise: Filtering and logic, arranging, and selecting

Time: 10 min

Copy and paste the code below into the script `exercises-wrangling.R` (in a new
Section, `Ctrl-Shift-R`). Then start replacing the `___` with the appropriate
code to complete the tasks below:

1. Filter so only those with BMI more than 20 *and* less than 40 *and* keep only
those with diabetes.
2. Filter to keep those who are working ("Work") *or* those who are renting
("HomeOwn") *and* those who do not have diabetes. Select the variables age,
gender, work status, home ownership, and diabetes status.
3. Using sorting and selecting, find out who has had the most number of babies
and how old they are.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# To see values of categorical data
summary(NHANES)

# 1. BMI between 20 and 40 and who have diabetes
NHANES %>%
    # format: variable >= number
    filter(___ >= ___ & ___ <= ___ & ___ == ___)

# 2. Working or renting, and not diabetes
___ %>%
    filter(___ == ___ | ___ == ___ & ___ == ___) %>% 
    select(___)

# 3. How old is person with most number of children.
___ %>%
    ___(___) %>% 
    ___(___) 
```

<details><summary><strong>Click for a possible solution</strong></summary>
<p>

```{r}
# 1. BMI between 20 and 40 and who have diabetes
NHANES %>%
    # format: variable >= number
    filter(BMI >= 20 & BMI <= 40 & Diabetes == "Yes")

# 2. Working or renting, and not diabetes
NHANES %>%
    filter(Work == "Working" | HomeOwn == "Rent" & Diabetes == "Yes") %>% 
    select(Age, Gender, Work, HomeOwn, Diabetes)

# 3. How old is person with most number of children.
NHANES %>%
    arrange(desc(nBabies)) %>% 
    select(Age, nBabies) 
```

</p>
</details>

## `group_by()`, `summarise()`: Create a summary of the data, alone or by a group(s)

Using `group_by()` on its own does nothing. But, combine it with other functions
like `summarise()` and you can do some very powerful data processing. This
particular combination of commands allows for the [split-apply-combine]
technique to be easily used. Many data analysis tasks can be approached using
this paradigm: split the data into groups, apply some analysis to each group,
and then combine the results together. Using `group_by()` splits the data up and
`summarise()` then applies an analysis and then combines it back together. The
arguments to `group_by()` are the column names that contain the **categorical**
variables for what you want to calculate the summary statistics.

[split-apply-combine]: https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v040i01

Let's first explore using `summarise()` on it's own, which outputs a single value
(e.g. a max or mean). Like `mutate()`, you can add multiple "summaries" by adding
new variables separated by commas.

```{r}
NHANES %>%
    summarise(MaxAge = max(Age, na.rm = TRUE),
              MeanBMI = mean(BMI, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Combine it with `group_by()`.

```{r}
# Grouped by gender
NHANES %>%
    group_by(Gender) %>% 
    summarise(MaxAge = max(Age, na.rm = TRUE),
              MeanBMI = mean(BMI, na.rm = TRUE))

# Grouped by gender and diabetes
NHANES %>%
    group_by(Gender, Diabetes) %>% 
    summarise(MeanAge = mean(Age, na.rm = TRUE),
              MeanBMI = mean(BMI, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## `gather()`: Converting from wide to long form

The tidyr package is a companion package to dplyr and allows for a wide range of
manipulations of the data structure data. For example, sometimes we have data
in the wide form as it is often easier to enter data in wide form. Wide form can
be useful when presenting as tables. But there are usually problems with wide
form data, especially when it comes to analysing it. Look at the table below,
which is in wide form. Wide form data also tends to be a bit "messier" then long
form. For instance, what do the values in the `1999` column mean? Unless you had
a data dictionary, you would not know what those values mean.

```{r table-example-wide-data, echo=FALSE}
kable(table4b, caption = "Example wide form dataset.")
```

The long form on the other hand is usually better suited for analyses and
visualizing, especially when doing [split-apply-combine] techniques. Long form
data also tends to be more *tidy* compared to wide form.

```{r table-example-long-data, echo=FALSE}
kable(table1 %>% select(-cases), caption = "Example long form dataset.")
```

We can get to this from the wide form through wrangling the data like so:

(ref:wide-long) Convert from wide to long. Taken from [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html).

```{r image-wide-long, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="(ref:wide-long)"}
# TODO: fix this. Get image directly.
# include_graphics("https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/3aea19108d39606bbe49981acda07696c0c7fcd8/2de65/images/tidy-9.png")
```

To go from wide to long we use `gather` to sweep up a set of columns into one
key-value pair. The **arguments** for `gather` are:

1. The name of a *new* column that contains the original column names
2. The name of a *new* column that contains the values from the original columns
3. The original columns we either want or do not want "gathered" up.

Compare how `table4b` looks normally and then after converting to the long form
with `gather()`.

```{r}
# Original data
table4b

# Convert to long form by stacking population by each year
# Use minue to exclude a variable (country) from being "gathered"
table4b %>% 
    gather(year, population, -country)

# This does the same:
table4b %>%
    gather(year, population, `1999`, `2000`)
```

This can be challenging to conceptually grasp at first. Let's try an example
situation when you may use `gather()`. Let's say you wanted to find out the
means of several characteristics of a population. You could use the `group_by()`
and `summarise()` combination on their own, but another method is using `gather()`
to group by and summarise all the variables at once.

```{r}
# Keep only variables of interest
nhanes_chars <- NHANES %>% 
    select(SurveyYr, Gender, Age, Weight, Height, BMI, BPSysAve)
nhanes_chars

# Convert to long form, excluding year and gender
nhanes_long <- nhanes_chars %>% 
    gather(Measure, Value, -SurveyYr, -Gender)
nhanes_long

# Calculate mean on each measure, by gender and year
nhanes_long %>% 
    group_by(SurveyYr, Gender, Measure) %>% 
    summarise(MeanValue = mean(Value, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Note that summarising by mean can only be done with continuous variables.
Anyway, with the long form, you can do more with less code :relaxed:

## `spread()`: (If time) Converting from long to wide form

You can also convert to wide from long. This is not as commonly done, since most
analyses are better in the long form. But sometimes you may need to have a wide
form. Here you can use `spread()`, which takes three arguments: 1) the data, 2)
the *key* column (or column with identifying information), 3) the *value*
column (the one with the numbers/values). We'll use a pipe so we can ignore the
data argument.

(ref:long-wide) 'Spreading' from long to wide. Taken from the [R for Data Science book](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html#spreading).

```{r image-long-to-wide, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="(ref:long-wide)"}
# TODO: fix this. Get image directly.
# include_graphics("https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/8350f0dda414629b9d6c354f87acf5c5f722be43/bcb84/images/tidy-8.png")
```

```{r}
# Using a small dataset:
table2

# Convert to wide form
table2 %>% 
    spread(key = type, value = count)
```

The key is the discrete value that will make up the new column names, while the
value will be column that will make up the values of the new columns.

## Final exercise: Replicate the output from the given dataset.

Time: Until end of the session.

In the `exercise-wrangling.R` file, copy the code below to get the data into the
form needed. Using everything you learned in this session, try to recreate the
table below from the dataset given here.

```{r nhanes-data}
```

```{r nhanes-output, echo=FALSE}
```
