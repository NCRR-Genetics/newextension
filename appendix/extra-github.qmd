# Extras: Create a GitHub repo {#sec-extra-github}

Open up GitHub in a browser, make sure you are logged in, and create a
new, empty repository. New repositories can be created by either
clicking the green "New" button on the left sidebar or by clicking the
`+` symbol at the top right to open a menu and selecting the "New
repository" item.

You'll be sent to a screen with some options for the new repository. For
now, type out `learning-github` as a name for the repository and leave
everything else blank. Make the repository "Private" for now. The video
below can be used as a reference.

Ok, we now have a remote repository to work with. The next step depends
on whether you have an existing repository with a history or you are
starting completely from new. If you haven't created a Git repository
and saved to its history locally, the easiest way of getting your GitHub
repository onto your computer as a local repository is to download it
(or to "clone" it in Git terms). You can "clone" a GitHub repository
easily from RStudio's "Create Project from Version Control" interface.
We'll do that now, as detailed in the videos below. Where you save the
new project doesn't matter, but to make things easy, save it to the
Desktop.

First we will find our repository link and create a new project from
version control.

When attempting to clone your repository, GitHub will require you to
authenticate yourself. In most cases when using GitHub, you can use the
password created during signup. However, when indirectly communicating
with GitHub using RStudio, we need to use a "Personal Access Token"
(PAT).

::: callout-tip
These tokens need to be manually generated on GitHub, and gives us a
more secure way to communicate with our GitHub account and repositories.
Creating a token can be confusing, but we have a
[guide](https://guides.rostools.org/connect-github#authenticating-with-github)
for that.
