**Are technical issues with your computer preventing you from completing
the pre-course tasks or doing the course sessions?**

A last-ditch solution may be to use the Posit Cloud platform to do the
course. *What is it?*

Posit Cloud is a cloud computing service hosted by Posit (formerly
called RStudio). It runs allows you to run the RStudio app in your web
browser with full functionality, including built-in integration of R
Projects and Git. It looks slightly different from a local RStudio
session, and it treats R Projects and Git a little different, but the
overall R user experience is virtually identical. For what we need in
this course, we are fine with their free service, which only requires a
little work to register and set up.

### Setting up Posit Cloud

<!-- TODO: Update images to reflect Posit Cloud change. -->

Register a free account: Go to the [Posit Cloud
website](https://posit.cloud/plans/free) and complete the sign-up
process for a free account.

Log in to the account. After logging in, we start on the "Personal
Workspace" page. Here we can create new R Projects (which we'll do
next), set up additional workspaces (which we don't need for this
course) or read the R guides and cheatsheets available in the "Learn"
section of the menu panel (we can explore those after the course,
there's a lot of good content):

![This is Posit Cloud.](../images/cloud-start.jpg)

Start a new R Project: Click the "New Project" button. To practice using
it, click the right half of the button and you get the option to create
a project by cloning a GitHub repository (more on that later):

![Create a new Posit Cloud Project.](../images/cloud-new-project.jpg)

We'll start a new project from scratch by clicking the button. Don't
forget to click the top panel after the project has been created to
rename it to something sensible. Great! Now we've set up an R Project:

![Our first Posit Cloud project. The interface is identical to a local
instance of RStudio.](../images/cloud-project.jpg)

Before we get ahead of ourselves, however, we'll tune the cloud
computing settings for the project to get more monthly run-time out of
our free account.

Throttle CPU and memory usage down: For this course, we don't need a lot
of computer power, so we can get by with just the minimum memory and CPU
settings. With these settings, we get 30 hours of run-time per month,
which should be plenty for this course. To do so, click the gear-icon in
the top right of the screen, then the "Resources" tab, toggle both
sliders to the far left, and click "Apply Changes":

![Tuning cloud resources. Slow and steady wins the
race!](../images/cloud-cpu-memory.jpg)

If you end up requiring more memory or CPU power, you can always turn
these settings up later. Cloud run-time is only accumulated while your
project is active, so if you find yourself running low on run-time, make
sure to exit your project when you're not actively coding.

Set up access to GitHub: Finally, we need to allow access to private
GitHub repositories, which we'll be using in this course. Click on your
user name in the top-right corner, and then the "Authentication" tab.
This will take us to the authentication options, where we tick both
boxes at the bottom for enabling GitHub, including the one labeled
"Private repo access also enabled":

![Enable access to private repositories on
GitHub.](../images/cloud-settings-github.jpg)

Setting up Git on Posit Cloud projects: Git cannot be set up inside the
project using packages, so `{prodigenr}` and `usethis::use_git()` will
not work. However, it can easily be done through the RStudio menu
interface:
`Tools -> Version Control -> Project Setup -> Version Control System: Git`

Now you're good to go! You should have no issues completing the
pre-course tasks (@sec-pre-course) and have a course experience similar
to those using a local installation.

There are just a few more differences between local and Posit Cloud
sessions to be aware of:

-   **Uploading files to Posit Cloud projects:** To make files available
    to Posit Cloud projects, we have to upload the files to it.
    Thankfully, this is very easy! In Posit Cloud, the "Files" tab of
    Panel D (@fig-rstudio-introduction) contains a new icon "Upload
    File", which allows us to easily upload a file from our local
    computer (or several files within a zip file) to the Posit Cloud
    folder we're currently in:

    ![Uploading files, e.g. datasets to the cloud is
    easy.](../images/cloud-upload.jpg)

    Another way of loading files to Posit Cloud is to synchronize the
    project with a remote repository, which will download all the
    tracked files to the Posit Cloud project.

-   **R projects and folder structure in Posit Cloud:** Since we start
    every R session inside of a project on Posit Cloud, RStudio in the
    cloud session doesn't let us set up projects from inside of the R
    session. The `{prodigenr}` package can still be used *through the
    console* to set up the basic folder structure of our projects.
    However, the root folder of any project is fixed to
    `/cloud/project/`, so when setting up our folder structure with
    `{prodigenr}`, we should have this in mind (e.g.
    `prodigenr::setup_project("LearningR")` creates the prodigenr
    folders inside`/cloud/project/LearningR` and avoids unnecessarily
    long file paths).

-   **Cloning a GitHub remote repository in Posit Cloud:** Can be done
    when setting up a new project in the Posit Cloud workspace ("New
    Project from Git Repo"), or from the terminal, but it cannot be done
    through the RStudio main menu interface.

## More formatting syntax in Markdown {#post-course-markdown}

### Block quotes

Block quotes are used when you want to emphasize a block of text,
usually for quoting someone. You create a block quote by putting a `>`
at the beginning of the line, and as with the lists and headers, it
needs empty lines before and after the text. So it looks like this:

``` markdown
> Block quote 
```

which gives...

> Block quote

### Adding footnotes

Footnotes are added by enclosing a number or word in square brackets
(`[]`) and beginning with an uptick (`^`). It looks like this:

``` markdown
Footnote[^1] or this[^note].

[^1]: Footnote content
[^note]: Another footnote
```

which gives...

Footnote[^resources-1] or this[^resources-2].

[^resources-1]: Footnote content

[^resources-2]: Another footnote

Now, if you scroll down to the bottom of the page, you will see these
footnotes.

### Adding links to websites

Including a link to a website in your document is done by surrounding
the link text with square brackets (`[]`) followed by the link URL in
brackets (`()`). There must **not** be any space between the square
brackets and the regular brackets (it should look like `[]()`).

``` markdown
[Link](https://google.com)
```

which gives...

[Link](https://google.com)

### Inserting (simple) tables

While you can insert tables using Markdown too, it isn't recommended to
do that for complicated or large tables. Tables are created by
separating columns with `|`, with the table header being separated by a
line that looks like `|:--|`. A simple example is:

    |   | Fun | Serious |
    |:--|----:|--------:|
    | **Happy** | 1234 | 5678 |
    | **Sad** | 123 | 456 |

which gives...

|           | Fun  | Serious |
|:----------|:----:|:-------:|
| **Happy** | 1234 |  5678   |
| **Sad**   | 123  |   456   |

The `|---:|` or `|:---|` tell the table to left-align or right-align the
values in the column. Center-align is `|:----:|`.

So you can probably imagine, doing this for larger or even slightly more
complicated tables is not practical. A good alternative approach is to
create the table in a spreadsheet, importing that table into R within a
code chunk, and using `knitr::kable()` to create the table after that.

## Other colour schemes in ggplot2

You can modify ggplot2 colour schemes using many other pre-defined
palettes by installing new R packages, including scientific journal
colour palettes ([ggsci](https://nanx.me/ggsci/index.html)) and even a
Wes Anderson ([wesanderson](https://github.com/karthik/wesanderson)) or
a Stubio Ghibli ([ghibli](https://ewenme.github.io/ghibli/)) colour
palette! Also check out the Data Visualization book in the section
below.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

<!-- TODO: Move this into a new file called FAQ, maybe on the guides site. -->

### Installation Problems

**Q: What do I do if I don't have admin rights and can't install the
newest versions of programs?**

-   A: Depending on your institutional policies and infrastructure, you
    may not be able to download newer versions of R and RStudio.
    Firstly, you should contact your IT support person to see whether
    you are able to access an updated version. While you could attempt
    to use the older version of these programs available to you, you may
    notice that some things either look quite different or not work at
    all. One solution is to use the Posit Cloud platform, as per the
    instructions in the section [Setting up Posit
    Cloud](#setting-up-rstudio-cloud).

**Q: Why did my output have so much red text when I tried to install
packages?**

-   A: Rest assured that this is simply the way that R informs you that
    packages are being installed, even though it may look scary. If
    there really was an error, the output would likely begin with a
    message saying "Error: ..." or "Warning: ...", to differentiate
    between informational compared to error messages.

**Q: Why did I receive a bunch of error messages when I tried to install
packages?**

-   A: For some Windows users, you may need to install
    [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/Rtools35.exe).

**Q: Help! My code isn't working, even though I've followed all the
instructions.**

-   A: This is the most common problem you will face, so we've dedicated
    Section @sec-encountering-problems-and-finding-help to
    troubleshooting solutions in the Management of R Projects section.
