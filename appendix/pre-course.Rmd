# Pre-course tasks {#pre-course}

In order to participate in this course, you must complete everything in
this pre-course tasks section and finish with *completing the survey* at
the end. These tasks are designed to make it easier for everyone to
start the course with everything set up. For some of the tasks, you
might not understand why you need to do them, but you will likely
understand why once the course begins.

Depending on your skills and knowledge, these tasks could take between
**3-5 hrs to finish**, so we suggest planning a full day to complete
them. Depending on your institution and how they handle installing
software on work computers, you also might have to contact IT *very
early* to make sure everything is properly installed and setup.

## Summary of tasks

Here's a quick overview of the tasks you need to do. Specific details
about them are found as you work through the tasks.

1.  Install R, RStudio, and Git. For some people, depending on their
    institution, this task can take the longest because you have to
    contact your IT to install these programs.
2.  Install necessary R packages.
3.  Read about and become familiar with RStudio.
4.  Read some of the course sections on Git.
5.  Configure Git on your computer and create a GitHub account.
6.  Run a check to see if everything works (you'll later need to paste
    this output into the survey).
7.  Read the syllabus.
8.  Read the Code of Conduct.
9.  Complete the pre-course survey. This survey is pretty quick, maybe
    \~10 minutes.

Check each section for exact details on completing these tasks.

## Installing the latest programs

The first thing to do is to install these programs. You may already have
some of them installed and if you do, please make sure that they are at
least the minimum versions listed below. If not, you will need to update
them.

1.  Install the latest version of
    [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/index.html) (anything above 4.0.0).
2.  Install the latest version of
    [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#download) (any
    version above 1.4).
3.  Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
4.  For most Windows users, you will need to install
    [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) in order
    for some R packages to be installed correctly (which you'll do
    shortly).

All these programs are required for the course, even Git. Git, which is
a software program to formally manage versions of files, is used because
of it's popularity and the amount of documentation available for it. At
the end of the course, you will be using Git and GitHub to manage your
group assignment. Check out the online book [Happy Git with
R](https://happygitwithr.com/), especially the "Why Git" section, for an
understanding on why we are teaching Git. Windows users tend to have
more trouble with installing Git than macOS or Linux users. See the
section on [Installing Git for
Windows](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html#install-git-windows)
for help.

> *A note to those who have or use work laptops with restrictive
> administrative privileges*: You may encounter problems installing
> software due to administrative reasons (e.g. you don't have permission
> to install things). Even if you have issues installing or updating the
> latest version of R or RStudio, you will likely be able to continue
> with the course as long as you have at least 4.0.0 for R and at least
> 1.4 for RStudio. If you have versions of R and RStudio that are older
> than that, you may need to ask your IT department to update your
> software if you can't do this yourself. Unfortunately, Git is not a
> commonly used software for some organizations, so you may not have it
> installed and you *will* need to ask IT to install it. We *require* it
> for the course, so please make sure to give IT enough time to be able
> to install it for you prior to the course.

Once R, RStudio, and Git have been installed, open RStudio. *If you
encounter any troubles during these pre-course tasks*, try as best as
you can to complete the task and then let us know about the issues in
the pre-course survey (at the end of this section). If you continue
having problems, indicate on the survey that you need help and we can
try to book a quick video call to fix the problem. Otherwise, you can
come to the course 15-20 minutes earlier to get help.

If you're unable to complete the setup procedure due to unfixable
technical issues, you can use RStudio Cloud as a final solution in order
to participate in the course. For help setting up RStudio Cloud for this
course, refer to the [RStudio Cloud setup
guide](resources#setting-up-rstudio-cloud).

## What is R?

During this course, we will be spending most of our time in RStudio.
RStudio is an environment that we use to interact with R. R is like an
engine, while RStudio is like the tools we use to actually work with
that engine. Prior to taking a look at what RStudio looks like, let's
talk briefly about R as a programming language.

R is a free programming language/environment used in statistical
computing, data analytics, and scientific research. R is used to clean,
organize, analyze, and report on data. R has powerful visualization
features, so it is a particularly useful tool for creating charts and
figures. R is different from SPSS and other statistical programs in that
you run analyses by typing commands in a console rather than using
click-based, drop-down menus.

In recent years, R has become one of the most popular languages among
statisticians and data scientists for several reasons:

-   It is open source, so you are able to see how exactly a, for
    instance, statistical method works.
-   It runs on all platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).
-   It is highly compatible with other programming languages.
-   It provides access to a vast array of packages that can complete
    nearly any task or statistical approach.
-   There is a huge online community to help you problem-solve any
    issue.
-   It is free, which means you can continue using the skills you gain
    in R throughout your entire career without worrying about expensive
    licensing fees (for example, if your employer can't or doesn't pay
    for the software).

However, like many programming languages, R is not easy to learn. Some
functions are spread across packages, which means that you need to have
prior knowledge of packages in order to implement some commands. R can
also be slower than other programming languages. Nonetheless, R offers
such a supportive community and rich functionality that it is worth the
challenge!

## Getting familiar with RStudio

Let's start learning about RStudio and how to use it. Check out Figure
\@ref(fig:rstudio-introduction) below. You can see that RStudio has four
"panels", dividing the screen into the four sections.

> **Note**: This image, along with the other images and videos below,
> may look slightly different from your own computer depending on your
> operating system and other settings.

```{r rstudio-introduction, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Interface to RStudio."}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images/rstudio-introduction.png"))
```

While you can customize where the individual panels go, the default
layout is how the panels are shown.

-   Panel "A" is the panel that shows the "scripts", which we will be
    using a lot during the course. You *may or may not see this panel*
    when you open RStudio for the first time. This panel is where you
    write R code that will be saved as a file.
-   Panel "B" is the Console. This is where R commands are sent and
    evaluated by R. This is the "engine". No R code written here is
    saved. Almost all of the tasks in this course will be entered
    through the Console.
-   Panel "C" contains the Environment, History, Connections, and Git
    tabs. In this course, we will only be using the Environment and Git
    tab.
-   Panel "D" has the Files, Plots, Packages, Help, Build, and Viewer
    tabs. For this course, we will only be going over the Files, Plots,
    Packages, and Help tabs. There can be slight differences in your
    layout of tabs in each panel.

While we will spend most of the course using R script files to play
around with code, we will also be learning and using [R
Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) (`.Rmd`). R Markdown is a
dynamic and invaluable tool that will help make your analysis more
reproducible. R Markdown allows you to interweave chunks of code along
with text and images. R runs the code and inserts the code output into
the R Markdown file. The R Markdown file can be converted into a wide
range of document types, including MS Word, PDF, or HTML. Some
researchers write and manage entire papers, theses, or books using R
Markdown, as it can make things easier to organize and maintain. In
fact, this website is written with R Markdown.

## Installing R packages

Now that you have RStudio and R on your computer, we need to install the
R packages we'll use in the course. R packages are bundles of R code
that other people have written. There are so many R packages available
that there is likely an R package for anything you'd like to do in R.
Making use of R packages can greatly help you out when doing your
research.

Before we continue, we need to briefly explain what some terms mean.

-   **R code** is any individual piece of text that R interprets as
    commands to do something. For instance, `mean()` is a complete piece
    of text that tells R to calculate the mean of some numbers.
-   **R script** is any file with the ending `.R` that contains R code
    that completes tasks in a sequence (from the top of the file to the
    bottom).
-   **R package** is a set of R scripts that contain bundles of R code
    that work together to expand on or improve R code and R
    functionality.

For this course, we will be focusing on R packages that are powerful and
general-purpose enough to help you in multiple aspects of your research.
To install these packages, we'll need to install the r3 helper package.
For that, we'll need to first install the
[remotes](https://remotes.r-lib.org/) package. Watch the video below to
see how to do this:

```{r rstudio-installing-remotes, echo=FALSE}
insert_video("videos/rstudio-installing-remotes.mp4")
```

Copy and paste the command below into the RStudio Console. Hit Enter and
the r3 helper package will be installed. Watch the video below to see
how to do this:

``` r
remotes::install_gitlab("rostools/r3", upgrade = TRUE)
```

```{r console-installing-r3, echo=FALSE}
insert_video("videos/console-installing-r3.mp4")
```

It is important to understand what you are doing when you enter a
function like `something::something()`. In the example of
`remotes::install_gitlab()`, you would "read" this as:

> R, can you please use the `install_gitlab` function from the remotes
> package?

You could load the package with `library(remotes)` and then run the
`install_gitlab()` function. However, using the `::` (pronounced "colon
colon") tells R that we want to use a function directly from a package.
We prefer this way as we only want to use the `install_gitlab()`
function from the remotes package without having to load all the other
functions. We will be using `::` often during this course.

Most of the packages we will be using in this course are bundled
together into one package called [tidyverse]. Tidyverse is a collection
of packages that are designed for common tasks in data science, ranging
from data exploration to data visualization. As the name suggests,
tidyverse is an attempt to organize the "universe" of data analysis by
providing packages that guide workflows and lead to more reproducible
analysis projects. When you installed the r3 helper package, it already
installed tidyverse for you. If you wanted to install tidyverse
normally, you would (but don't right now) type in the Console:

``` r
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

The specific packages from tidyverse that we will use are
[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/),
[dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/), and
[rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). These packages provide a
set of tools for the most common data analysis tasks, and have excellent
documentation and tutorials on how to use them.

There are two core packages contained within tidyverse that we will use
more regularly.

-   [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) (along with a complementary
    package [tidyr](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/)) is a package that is
    very popular and contains important data manipulation functions,
    including functions that select and/or create variables depending on
    certain conditions. [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) is built
    to work directly with data frames (rectangular data like those found
    in spreadsheets), and has an additional feature to interact directly
    with data stored in an external database such as in SQL. Working
    with databases is a powerful way to work with massive datasets (100s
    of GB), more than what your computer could normally handle. Working
    with massive data won't be covered in this course, but see this
    [resource from Data
    Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/05-r-and-databases.html)
    to learn more.

<!-- -->

-   [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) is a data visualization
    package that can be used to create bar charts, pie charts,
    histograms, scatterplots, error charts, and more. It uses a
    "grammar" as a way to construct and customize your graphs in a
    layered, descriptive approach.

## Setting up Git and GitHub

We'll cover more about Git and GitHub during the course, but for now,
please read sections \@ref(what-is-version-control), \@ref(what-is-git),
and \@ref(basics-of-git). Git and version control are some of the more
difficult things you will learn in this course, because they are
fundamentally very different ways of working than you are probably used
to. They require changing how you see and interact with your projects
and computer in pretty big ways. So we want you to read this now so you
can start to mentally process the concepts we will cover. We'll also get
you to read it again during the course, to reinforce the concepts.

After reading about Git, we need you to prepare things so that you are
ready for the course. In order to use Git properly, you need to inform
your computer that you are using Git. The r3 course helper package has a
function to help with this. Type in the RStudio Console:

``` r
r3::setup_git_config()
```

Hit enter and follow the instructions. Finally, type and run this next
function to make sure everything is working with your setup. When you
complete the survey later, you will need to copy and paste the output of
this function.

``` r
r3::check_setup()
```

After you are done, you need to [create a GitHub
account](https://github.com/join). See Figure
\@ref(fig:github-account-creation) for a demonstration of how to do
that. Make note of your username, as we will ask you for it in the
pre-course survey. Make sure to **remember your password**, either write
it down somewhere or (even better) use a password manager to store your
password for you.

> Note: *GitHub* is a company and website, while *Git* is a software.
> There is sometimes confusion about these two things since they both
> say "Git". It's important to distinguish that they are two *separate*
> things.

```{r github-account-creation, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Creating a GitHub account."}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("videos/github-account-creation.gif"))
```

## Course introduction

Most of the description of the course is found in the
[syllabus](syllabus.html). A shortcut to quickly access the syllabus
from RStudio is to enter `r3::open_syllabus()` or click it from the menu
bar on the side.

While you may have signed up to this course to learn more about R, you
should know that conducting reproducible research goes beyond R and
RStudio. As such, we will be spending a lot of time exploring other
tools that are used in conjunction with R, to improve the structure and
transparency of your work. This course is designed to not only introduce
you to R, but also to show ways of conducting reproducible research and
data analysis in R.

If you haven't read the syllabus, **please read it now**. Read over what
the course will cover, what we expect you to learn by the end of it, and
what our basic assumptions are about who you are and what you already
know. At the end of this section, we'll ask you a few questions to see
if you understand what you'll learn in the course.

One goal of the course is to teach about open science, and true to our
mission, we practice what we preach. The course material is publicly
accessible (all on this website) and [openly licensed](license.html) so
you can (re-)use it for free! The material is organized in the order
that we will cover it in the course.

While the course will include lots of hands-on work during the sessions,
the final group [project assignment](assignment.html) will allow you to
practice everything you've learned in a team setting. To quickly access
the final project assignment from inside RStudio, run the function
`r3::open_assignment()`. **Please read it** to get familiar with what is
expected of you.

We have a [Code of Conduct](conduct.html). If you haven't read it,
**read it now**. The survey involves some questions about Conduct. We
want to make sure this course is a supportive and safe environment for
learning, so this Code of Conduct is quite important.

You're almost done. Please fill out the pre-course survey to finish this
section, either [at this
link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeuMe485zZXlG9uQlUgcgsWBJvpHUB_-bMVkEtA4moWK_oUoQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)
or with this function:

``` r
r3::open_pre_survey()
```

See you at the course!
