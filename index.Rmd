The course is designed as a series of participatory live-coding lessons, where
the instructor and learner code together, has hands-on
exercises interspersed throughout the course, 
and has a final group assignment of doing a simple data analysis project.
This website contains all of the
material for the course, from reading material to exercises, to images. It is
structured as a book, with "chapters" as lessons, given in order of appearance.
We make heavy use of the website throughout the course
where code-along sessions follow the material on the website nearly exactly
(with slight modifications for time or more detailed explanations).

The course material was created using [rmarkdown] to write the lessons,
[bookdown] to create the book format, [GitLab] to host the [Git] 
repository of the material, and [GitLab CI] with [Netlify] to create the website.
The original source material for this course is found on the 
[`r-cubed`] GitLab repository.
