The course is designed as a series of participatory live-coding lessons, where
the instructor and learner code together, along with hands-on
exercises interspersed throughout the course
and a final group assignment to do a simple data analysis project.
This website contains all of the
material for the course, from reading material to exercises to code to images. It is
structured as a book, with "chapters" as lessons, given in order of appearance.
We make heavy use of the website throughout the course
where code-along sessions almost identically follow the material on the website 
(with slight modifications for time or more detailed explanations).

The course material was created using [rmarkdown] to write the lessons,
[bookdown] to create the book format, [GitLab] to host the [Git] 
repository of the material, and [GitLab CI] with [Netlify] to create the website.
The original source material for this course is found on the 
[`r-cubed`] GitLab repository.

## Target audiences

This website and its content are targeted to three groups:

1. For the **learners** to use during the course, both to follow along in case they get
lost and also to use as a reference after the course ends.
2. For the **instructors** to use as a guide for when they do the code-along
sessions and lectures.
3. For those who are **interested in teaching**, who may not have much experience
or may not know where to start, to use this website as a guide to running
and instructing their own workshops.

## Previous versions

There have been two previous "formal" versions of the course given so far:

- [Version 1](https://v1--dda-rcourse.netlify.app/) taught in March 2019.
- [Version 2](https://r-cubed-v2.rostools.org/) taught in June 2020.

## Contributors {#contributors}

Contributors for [version 1](https://v1--dda-rcourse.netlify.app/) were:

- Luke Johnston: Brainstormed most of the course material and structure; set up
the website; organized and coordinated the course; wrote, prepared, and taught
most of the code-along sessions, as well as several lectures.
- Daniel Witte: Participated in brainstorming on the course structure and
layout; prepared and taught most of the lectures.
- João Santiago: Taught and edited the R Markdown code-along session material.
- Anna Schritz: Taught and edited the Data Management and Wrangling code-along
session material.
- Omar Silverman (helper): Proofread and provided feedback on the material for several
sessions.

Contributors for [version 2](https://r-cubed-v2.rostools.org/) were:

- Luke Johnston: Same as with version 1.
- Daniel Witte: Prepared and taught most of the lectures.
- Helene Bæk Juel: Edited and taught the Data Visualization code-along session material,
as well as reviewed multiple other sections.
- Bettina Lengger: Edited and taught the Data Management and Wrangling code-along
session material, as well as reviewed multiple other sections.

Contributors for version 2.1 all participated in discussions on improving the
course, extensively updating the course material based on the participant
feedback from the previous courses, and heavily reviewing and editing the
content:

- Luke Johnston
- Daniel Witte
- Helene Bæk Juel
- Bettina Lengger
- Malene Revsbech Christiansen (helper from version 2)
- Anders Aasted Isaksen (helper from version 2)
- Hannah Chatwin (participant from version 2)
