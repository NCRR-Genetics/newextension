Reproducibility and open scientific practices are increasingly demanded of
scientists and researchers. Training on how to apply these practices in data
analysis has not kept up with demand. With this course, we hope to begin meeting
that demand. Using a very practical approach based mostly on code-along sessions
(instructor and learner coding together), the course will:

1. Explain what an open and reproducible data analysis workflow is, what it
looks like, and why it is important.
1. Explain and demonstrate why R is rapidly becoming the standard program of
choice for doing modern data analysis in science.
1. Demonstrate and apply collaborative tools and techniques when working in team
settings (including working with your future self).
1. Show and apply the fundamental tools and skills for conducting a
reproducible and modern analysis for a research project.
1. Show where to go to get help and to continue learning modern data analysis
skills.
