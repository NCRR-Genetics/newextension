## Workshop details

### Instructor and helper number

Recommended number of instructors for a 25-35 class size is about 3-6
instructors (~1 instructors for every 1-2 sessions). If there are more instructors,
then less helpers are needed. The recommended combined total number of helpers
and instructors is about 6 for a smooth workflow experience for the learners.

### First day

Before the introduction session (maybe the day before),
assign people into groups and create GitHub teams for them using the [ghclass] package.
Then in the room, arrange the tables into groups for each of the groups.
As participants come in, get them to sit in their assigned group number.

Some time during the session, get them to stand in line and arrange themselves from 
"complete beginner" to "know a little bit" for R, data analysis, and programming.
During the introduction, describe the assignment and what's the purpose of the groups.

Before the lunch break, get the groups to have lunch together and 
to introduce each other. Get them to tell the others their name, 
program, one thing they are excited or 
most interested to learn about R and/or data analysis.
