## Workshop details

### Instructor and helper number

Recommended number of instructors for a 25-35 class size is about 3-6
instructors (~1 instructors for every 1-2 sessions). If there are more instructors,
then less helpers are needed. The recommended combined total number of helpers
and instructors is about 6 for a smooth workflow experience for the learners.

### Introduction session

Notes: Describe assignments and form groups during introduction.
Get them in line from "complete beginner to computing" to "know a little bit".
Then assign numbers for groups then. Structure room into group tables, but get 
them to sit wherever but not get comfortable when they sit down (since they will
move).
