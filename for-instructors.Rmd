## Workshop details

### Instructor and helper number

Recommended number of instructors for a 25-35 class size is about 3-6
instructors (~1 instructors for every 1-2 sessions). If there are more instructors,
then less helpers are needed. The recommended combined total number of helpers
and instructors is about 6 for a smooth workflow experience for the learners.

### Before course begins

Setting up groups:

Before the introduction session (maybe the day before),
assign people into groups and create GitHub teams for them using the [ghclass] package.

Generate random names for groups based on tidytext::parts_of_speech$pos and
praise::praise_parts$adjective

### First day

In the room, arrange the tables into groups for each of the groups.
As participants come in, get them to sit in their assigned group number.

Some time during the session, get them to stand in line and arrange themselves from 
"complete beginner" to "know a little bit" for R, data analysis, and programming.
During the introduction, describe the assignment and what's the purpose of the groups.

Before the lunch break, get the groups to have lunch together and 
to introduce each other. Get them to tell the others their name, 
program, one thing they are excited or 
most interested to learn about R and/or data analysis.

### About the slides

The slides 

In the [remark.js] slides, generated from [xaringan], 
there are additional Notes

See the remark.js list of [keyword shortcuts] for using the slides to better
make use of them.

## Session specific instructions

### Data management and wrangling

For the first section on "messy" vs "tidy" data, 
get the learners to read the text themselves, 
then walk through what it means and why to do it.

## Making use of the stickies

- Check in with the learners to see where they are at by asking something like:
"Do you see the same thing as is on the screen? 
If yes, put the 'all good' sticky on your laptop. 
If no, use the 'need help' sticky."
- For the reading activities, before starting, ask:
"Please read this section as instructed. 
When you are done, put the 'all good' sticky up."
- For exercises, before starting, ask:
"Please complete the exercise. When you are done,
please put the 'all good' sticky up.
If you need help, put the 'need help' sticky up."

## Other comments

For the exercises, make sure to get the learners helping each other out in the
groups.
