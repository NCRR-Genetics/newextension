    - Code of Conduct
- What is reproducibility

# Question: 

## How many know or have heard about <u>reproducibility</u>?

---

class: center, middle

# Question: 

## How many know or have heard about <u>open science</u>?

---

class: center, middle

# Question: 

## ...or even <u>open access, open data, open methods/protocols, or open source</u>?

---

class: center, middle

# How many have read a method in a paper and wondered how they <u>actually</u> did it? 

???

Because you are trying to do the same or similar?

---

## Often, (way) more is done than shown in "Methods"

---

## Has anyone ever received confusing code? Or maybe have written your own confusing code?

# These issues can be fixed by creating and nurturing a culture of openness

---

## Code sharing: From scientific principle of "reproducibility" 

... often confused with "replicability" `r Cite(bib, "Plesser2018a")`<sup>1</sup>

--

.pull-left[
### Replicability

- Repeating a study by *independently* performing another identical study
- Difficult, usually needs funding
- Linked to the "irreproducibility crisis"<sup>2</sup> (covered later)
]

--

.pull-right[
### Reproducibility

- Generating the exact same results when using the same data and code
- Should be easy right? Wrong, often just as hard
- *Question*: If we can't even *reproduce* a studies results, how can we expect 
to replicate it?
]

.footnote[
1. Also from a American Statistical Association [statement](https://www.amstat.org/asa/files/pdfs/POL-ReproducibleResearchRecommendations.pdf).  
2. Or rather "irreplicability crisis".

## Biomedical studies almost entirely don't publish code with the published paper

- Very few papers provide code `r Cite(bib, c("Leek2017a", "Considine2017a"))`
    - Except bioinformatics, about 60% of studies do

--

- Example: In epidemiology, of 90 articles reviewed `r Cite(bib, "Peng2006a")`:
    - 43 (48%) did not report how data was processed
    - 21 (24%) did not report how analysis was conducted
    - 0 made code available in any way

???

*Why*? Likely due to:

- Lack of awareness and training
- Difficulty of adoption
- No incentive or reward
- Little to no culture to do it

---

## Open science: Terms and meanings

.center[

| **Term** | **Meaning** |
|:------------|:---------------|
| Open science | Freely available, openly licensed material for all things related to scientific activity |
| Open access | Free, unrestricted, publicly available **published articles** |
| Open data | Freely available, re-usable, openly licensed **data** |
| Open source/code | Freely available, re-usable, openly licensed **scientific code** used in generating results |
| Open methods/protocol | Freely available, re-usable, openly licensed **methods and protocols** used to create the data |

# Goal of this course? Start changing the culture by providing the training.

---

## So why are we using R and why learn it?

Include more "why's, reasons, etc" for using R and for doing reproducibility. Have more lectures in the first section where the previous "intro" material was (after adding the pre-workshop assignment).

Make comment about tidyverse vs base and why teaching this first.

---

## Course website and layout:

- Use r3 package to help with learning in course

- True to our mission, material publicly accessible and [openly licensed](https://dda-rcourse.lwjohnst.com/license/index.html)
    - <https://dda-rcourse.lwjohnst.com/>

- Course is mix of "code-alongs" and lectures
    - Interspersed with hands-on exercises
    - Combined with final group [assignment](assignment)

???

With the final group project, you'll be in the same group for the course,
working together on it and on the final exercises.
As a team, you'll help each other out with learning and overcoming any struggles,
with of course our help too!

---

## Asking for help

- Asking for help is as easy as using a sticky on your laptop
    - We have lots of helpers!

- We're all learning here
    - This is a supportive and safe environment
    - Remember our [Code of Conduct](conduct)

## Activity: Stand and arrange based on question

???

We're going to do a "stand and re-arrange yourself" activity based on some questions I ask.


Questions:

- Who's has not yet used R?
    - For those that have, who has had some type of formal training in "coding in R"?
    - Who has had struggles with it?
- Experience with using R
- Experience with using 

Find some way to use the "stand and arrange based on range" technique (like agree-disagree line). This could be done to order everyone by "novice-advanced", etc.

## Get into your groups

- Quickly introd

???

Here we will switch over to the next instructor, get setup, and do the next session.
