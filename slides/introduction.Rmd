# Question: 

## How many know or have heard or know about <u>reproducibility</u>?

---

class: center, middle

# Question: 

## How many know or have heard or know about <u>open science</u>?

---

class: center, middle

# Question: 

## ...or even <u>open access, open data, or open source</u>?

---

class: center, middle

# How many have read a method in a paper and wondered how they <u>actually</u> did it? 

???

Because you are trying to do the same or similar?

---

## Often, (way) more is done than shown in "Methods"

## Has anyone ever received confusing code? Or maybe have written your own confusing code?

# These issues can be fixed by creating and nurturing a culture of openness

---

## Code sharing: From scientific principle of "reproducibility" 

... often confused with "replicability" `r Cite(bib, "Plesser2018a")`<sup>1</sup>

--

.pull-left[
### Replicability

- Repeating a study by *independently* performing another identical study
- Difficult, usually needs funding
- Linked to the "irreproducibility crisis"<sup>2</sup> (covered later)
]

--

.pull-right[
### Reproducibility

- Generating the exact same results when using the same data and code
- Should be easy right? Wrong, often just as hard
- *Question*: If we can't even *reproduce* a studies results, how can we expect 
to replicate it?
]

.footnote[
1. Also from a American Statistical Association [statement](https://www.amstat.org/asa/files/pdfs/POL-ReproducibleResearchRecommendations.pdf).  
2. Or rather "irreplicability crisis".

## Biomedical studies almost entirely don't publish code with the published paper

- Very few papers provide code `r Cite(bib, c("Leek2017a", "Considine2017a"))`
    - Except bioinformatics, about 60% of studies do

--

- Example: In epidemiology, of 90 articles reviewed `r Cite(bib, "Peng2006a")`:
    - 43 (48%) did not report how data was processed
    - 21 (24%) did not report how analysis was conducted
    - 0 made code available in any way

--

- *Why*? Likely due to:
    - Lack of awareness and training
    - Difficulty of adoption
    - No incentive or reward
    - Little to no culture to do it

---

## Open science: Terms and meanings

.center[

| **Term** | **Meaning** |
|:------------|:---------------|
| Open science | Freely available, openly licensed .red.bold[*] material for all things related to scientific activity |
| Open access | Free, unrestricted, publicly available **published articles** |
| Open data | Freely available, re-usable, openly licensed **data** |
| Open source/code | Freely available, re-usable, openly licensed **scientific code** used in generating results |

]

.footnote[.red.bold[*] We'll cover licenses later.]

# Goal of this course? Start changing the culture by providing the training.

---

## Course website and layout:

- True to our mission, material publicly accessible and [openly licensed](https://dda-rcourse.lwjohnst.com/license/index.html)
    - <https://dda-rcourse.lwjohnst.com/>
- Course is mix of "code-alongs" and lectures
    - Interspersed with hands-on exercises
    - Combined with final group-work [assignment](https://dda-rcourse.lwjohnst.com/course/assignment/)
    (more on this later)

### What we aim to teach (and you learn)

- Recognize importance of reproducibility and open science
- Know and be aware of (some of) the modern tools to use
- Know a general workflow for doing analyses
- Know in general how to navigate and code in R
- How to generally think about data

]

--

.pull-right[

### What you won't learn

- No (or minimal) statistics or modelling
- No writing skills
- No study or experimental design
- No spreadsheet or large databases (e.g. SQL)

]

---

## Other considerations

- We have a [Code of Conduct](https://dda-rcourse.lwjohnst.com/code-of-conduct/)
- Asking for help is as easy as using a sticky on your laptop
    - We have lots of helpers!
- We're all learning here, this is a supportive and safe environment

--

## Resources and further reading

- Best practices see `r Cite(bib, c("Wilson2014a", "Eglen2016a"))`
- [Case studies](https://www.practicereproducibleresearch.org/) and lessons for doing reproducibility
- Case study in Bioinformatics see `r Cite(bib, "Kim2018a")`

## References 1

```{r refs1, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
PrintBibliography(bib, start = 1, end = 7)
```

---

## Stand and arrange

Find some way to use the "stand and arrange based on range" technique (like agree-disagree line). This could be done to order everyone by "novice-advanced", etc.

### Groups

Can skip first intro part during in-class. Get them into groups right away, do exercises together, etc.

## What is R and why learn it?

Include more "why's, reasons, etc" for using R and for doing reproducibility. Have more lectures in the first section where the previous "intro" material was (after adding the pre-workshop assignment).

Make comment about tidyverse vs base and why teaching this first.

Lastly, please make sure to bring a laptop to the course, 
since we do hands-on learning
