Raise your hands.

## :raising_hand_woman: Before this course... How many knew or have heard about <u>open science</u>? {.center}

## :raising_hand_man: Before this course... or even <u>open access, open data, open methods/protocols, or open source</u>? {.center}

## :raising_hand_woman: How many have read a method in a paper and wondered how they <u>actually</u> did it? {.center}

::: notes
Because you are trying to do the same or similar?

And you've probably realize by now, way more is done than shown in the
"Methods".
:::

## :raising_hand_man: Have you ever received confusing code? Or maybe have written your own confusing code?

::: notes
For those that have worked with code.

I definitely have in my research career. We want to change the culture
around code by encouraging and teaching how to share code and to write
better code in general.

## The scientific principle of "reproducibility" and code sharing {.smaller}

... often confused with "replicability" [@Plesser2018a]
[^introduction-1]

[^introduction-1]: Also from [American Statistical
    Association](https://www.amstat.org/asa/files/pdfs/POL-ReproducibleResearchRecommendations.pdf).

::: notes
How many could tell me the difference between replicable and
reproducible?
:::

. . .

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Replicability

-   Same analysis + same methods + new data = same result?
-   *Independently* conducted study
-   Difficult, usually needs funding
-   Linked to the "irreproducibility crisis"[^introduction-2]
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Reproducibility

-   Same data + same code = same result?
-   Should be easy right? Wrong, often just as hard
-   *Question*: If we can't even *reproduce* a studies results, how can
    we expect to replicate it?
:::
:::

[^introduction-2]: Or rather "irreplicability crisis".

# Big problem... {.center}

## Biomedical studies almost entirely don't publish code with the published paper [@Leek2017a, Considine2017a] {.center}

## Code sharing is abysmal across health sciences `r Cite(bib, c("Considine2017a", "Leek2017a", "Seibold2021"))`

::: notes
Vast majority of papers *still* don't provide code. Except for maybe in
bioinformatics, where a bit more than half of studies do. There are lots
of reasons for this, that I talk more about tomorrow.

We can't have reproducibility if no one shares their code!

And this is no joke. Getting data on this is difficult, but the research
that has been done shows that almost no one is sharing their code. The
estimates range between fields in health science from zero to maybe five
percent of published studies. The only area that is doing pretty well is
bioinformatics, at about 60% of published studies.
:::

## How can we check reproducibility if no code is given? [^introduction-3]

[^introduction-3]: This is a little bit of a rhetorical question
    :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

::: notes
This is a little bit of a rhetorical question, but how might we?
:::

## Recent study: Only 25% could be *executed* without some "cleaning up" `r Cite(bib, "Trisovic2022")`

-   Code taken from [Dataverse Project](https://dataverse.org/) data
    repositories
-   After some automatic cleaning, \~half could *execute*

???

Recent large study on general reproducibility of projects that shared
code.

Initially only 25% of the R scripts could be *executed* (doesn't mean
results were reproduced though). After doing automatic and some manual
code cleaning, than about half could be executed. That's not bad.

Since scripts were taken from Dataverse.org, researchers who upload
their code and projects to it probably are a bit more aware and
knowledgeable about general reproducibility and coding then the average
researcher, so the results are a bit biased.

# But scientific culture is not well-prepared for analytic and computation era

# Open science and reproducibility are some of multiple large trends

## Like quality/rigor, team science, communication, computing, data, meta-analysis, and meta-research

## These issues can be fixed by creating and nurturing a culture of openness {.center}

::: notes
All of this is because of a problem with our culture in research. We
aren't open, we don't really share, and don't often follow basic
principles of science. To fix this, we need to start creating and
nurturing a better and healthier culture. We all can be involved in
that, we all have that power to do something, even if its small thing.
:::

# Goal of this course? {.center}

## Start changing the culture by providing the training {.center}

## Often asked: So why are we using R and why learn it?

.pull-left\[ - Open source, free

-   Very large online community
    -   Learning resources, support, help
-   Massive selection of packages
    -   Latest statistical methods
    -   Productivity tools
    -   Report writing
    -   Visualization \]

.pull-right\[ - Recent push to improve teaching, usability - e.g. with
tidyverse, RStudio

-   One of best visualization tools available

-   Powerful capabilities

    -   Big Data
    -   Programming
    -   Reproducibility \]

???

Regarding it being free, that means that you can take the knowledge and
skills for using R anywhere you go.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Often asked: Why are we spending time on learning things other than R?

Because the course is about doing *open and reproducible research*,
while using R.

::: notes
At least a few times, we get feedback in our survey about the fact we
didn't spend enough time learning R or they expected more R. That's
because we're teaching open and reproducible research, and that involves
more than just R.

With the final group project, you'll be in the same group for the
course, working together on it and on the final exercises. As a team,
you'll help each other out with learning and overcoming any struggles,
with of course our help too!

I've tried to organize the groups to include a range of skills and
experiences, so there is a mix of novice and more experienced users.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Getting or asking for help `r emo::ji("raising_hand_woman")`

.pull-left\[ - Put the sticky on your laptop to get help - There are
lots of helpers - Team members, try to help out too\]

.pull-right\[ - We're all learning here! - This is a supportive and safe
environment - Remember our [Code of Conduct](conduct.html)

-   We have a [cheatsheet](resources/cheatsheet.pdf)! \]

# Practice using stickies: Have you re-installed r3 and joined the GitHub Organization as well as the Slack group?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

class: middle

# Activity:

## Stand and arrange `r emo::ji("walking_man")` or raise hand `r emo::ji("raising_hand_woman")` based on question

???

We're going to do a "stand and re-arrange yourself" activity based on
some questions I ask.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

class: middle

## Who has not yet used R?

???

Go into different corners for "yes" and "no".

------------------------------------------------------------------------

class: middle

## Those who've used R, how do you perceive your skill in R? `r emo::ji("walking_man")`

???

Along the wall, arrange to one side is "novice/basic" and other side is
"advanced".

------------------------------------------------------------------------

class: middle

## Those who've used R or other coding tool (like Stata), have you had formal training in "coding" in it? `r emo::ji("raising_hand_woman")`

???

Raise hands.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

class: middle

## How do you perceive your general skill in data analysis? `r emo::ji("walking_man")`

???

Along the wall, arrange from "novice/basic" to "advanced".

------------------------------------------------------------------------

class: middle

## Get back into your groups and get to know each other a bit more

???

So, as we prepare for the next session, introduce yourselves to the
group and get to know each other more. You'll be relying on them for
help, so find out who is the "more experienced" R user.
