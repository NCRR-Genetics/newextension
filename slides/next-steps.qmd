## Reproducibility is a spectrum, not a binary state

## Sadly (not going to lie) there are still very strong barriers to progress...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Institutional barriers

???

You will encounter a lot of resistance, a lot of barriers and hardship.

--

-   Lack of adequate awareness, support, infrastructure, training

???

At the institutional level, there is no real awareness of this, no
support or infrastructure. You're basically doing this on your own.
Which probably isn't that uncommon anyway.

--

-   Research culture values publications over all else

???

Research culture and incentives pretty much only care about publishing
journal articles. Creating software tools or datasets to be shared, meh.
Making teaching materials to help other researchers, meh. Communicating
your science to the public and doing outreach, meh. Doing actual science
that might take years and not lead to any "hard papers", meh.

--

-   Legal and privacy concerns about sharing data, intellectual property
    protection, patents, etc

???

Legal and privacy concerns are big topics that institutions in
particular focus on a lot, about ownership and so on, since research can
lead to commercialization and the potential for profit. For individual
researchers, we often worry about these concerns too much and sometimes
stops us from doing work because we're afraid we're doing something
wrong

--

-   More traditional academics don't understand or resist change

???

We have a large portion of traditional academics who have benefited from
and succeeded in this system and are invested in continuing it. They
often say there's nothing wrong with the system. This is what we in
epidemiology call "survivorship bias". There's nothing wrong, for them,
because they succeeded. But all the others that didn't succeed? We don't
count that data.

--

-   'Business as usual' is easier

???

We have a system that favours each individual person repeating the same
mistakes that others make because the system doesn't allow for us to
take the time to create tools and infrastructure that helps ourselves
and others out.

Because business as usual is the easiest way in the short term. Our
current scientific culture is just not prepared for this, for the rising
modern analytic and computational era.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ...and personal barriers

.pull-left\[ - Fear of: - Fear of being scooped or ideas being stolen -
Not being credited for ideas - Errors and public humiliation - Risk to
reputation\]

???

And there aren't just institutional barriers. We as researchers have
fears of being scooped, of embarrassment and humiliation for your
methods being *gasp* wrong. Which is actually just part of science.

--

.pull-right\[ - Overwhelmed with everything that needs to be done

-   Need to constantly stay updated

-   Finding better opportunities outside of academia \]

???

It is also really overwhelming, having so many things to think about to
make sure you're doing solid science. No researcher in the past had to
consider and think and know as much as we have to know and to do.
Another reason why we need more team science, to distribute the tasks
and skills.

You also have to constantly stay updated, and that can be tiring.

And the last barrier, which may actually be a benefit, is that one
reason you don't see a lot of researchers sharing their code or being
more reproducible is.. they end up getting picked up by industry and
paid really well or decide to leave academia for the reasons I
mentioned.

Just as an example, I found a Norwegian group who had a really
inefficient workflow and decided to re-build their workflow to make use
of programming, to be reproducible, to have a pipeline. I looked up the
lead author as well as several other of the co-authors and guess what...
many of them now work in really great companies as data scientists or
software engineers, probably making a lot of money and having
potentially a less stressful life.

# So... what can you do right now?

## Easiest thing: Start sharing your code

.footnote\[No matter how ugly. It also doesn't mean it'll be
reproducible, but at least it will be *inspectable*. \]

???

If you do nothing else: share your code.

If its ugly, that's fine! The point is you start and that you get more
comfortable doing it until it becomes second nature to share and in the
process, your code gets better because you know someone might look at
your code.

And even if your code isn't reproducible, even if others can't run it
own their own, sharing is the first step to becoming better. At the
least, others can inspect your code for its overall logic.

We as researchers try to find our niche, make our own space in the
research world. Sometimes its a real struggle to find that niche.. but
guys! No one is doing this, no one is sharing their code! You start
doing the simplest thing of sharing your code and you will be one of
very very few people who do. And this isn't a niche, this is a gaping
hole in our modern scientific process. A huge hole.

-   Take 2 minutes (instructor will set time) and consider:
    -   What would you spend your time on?
    -   What would you do differently compared to now?
-   *With your neighbour*, share what you've thought
    -   Each person has 2 minutes
-   After, we'll share some of the thoughts
