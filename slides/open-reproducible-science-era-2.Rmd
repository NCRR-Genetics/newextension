## Reproducible research is part of several large trends

- Openness
- Transparency
- Quality: Reproducibility
- Collaboration / Team work
- Communication

---

## Many rapid changes to key infrastructures of science

We are in the middle of an exponential growth curve:

- Data production
- Data storage and transfer
- Computing power
- Published research
- Complexity of methods

---

## Good modern example: UK Biobank

.center[
```{r, out.height="55%", out.width="55%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/biobank.jpg")
```
]

---

## But we scientists still think from "cottage industry" perspective

- Industrialisation of the research work flow
- Specialisation in research tasks

.pull-left[
```{r, out.height="70%", out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/Cottage_industry.png")
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, out.height="70%", out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/Powerloom.jpg")
```
]

## Current scientific culture not prepared for analytic and computation era

---

## Why? Still very strong barriers to change

- Tools needed
- Tradition, culture and common practices
- Researchers don't yet see value in adopting open, reproducible workflow
- Training and reward systems need to be adapted:
	- Publication
	- Academic recognition / careers
	- Research funding mechanisms
- Law: privacy concerns about sharing data, IP protection, patents, etc.

## Open science debates and initiatives don't recognize role of software

.footnote[E.g. [EU H2020 Open Science Mandate] only mentions data and publications.]

## Little to no training in software or programming

.center[
```{r self-taught-comic, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", out.height="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../img/code-quality.png")
```

## What does it mean for you?

- Need to stay updated: Keep learning
    - Read [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) books (most free)
    - Ask (and answer!) questions on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
    - Teach others!! Great way to learn :)
    - Read e.g. [Open Science Handbook](https://open-science-training-handbook.gitbook.io/book/)

--

- Find and collaborate with those familiar with these concepts (online and/or in real life)

--

- Cite research that is or tries to be more reproducible

--

- Keep the principles of reproducibility in mind, then find the tools

--

- Practice reproducible and open science
    - More on this later in session

---

## Recognize importance of code and data: Cite them!

--

```{r cite-packages, echo=TRUE}
# Example:
citation("dplyr")
```

---

## Comment: True reproducibility is very difficult

- Requires self-contained virtual environment
- With exact package versions and operating system used
- Tools to do this include:
    - [Docker] virtual containers [1]
    - Continuous intergration with [Travis] [2]

--

**...but this is not the goal, nor should it be**

- Tools to simplify this are being developed
    - Keep eye out

[Travis]: https://travis-ci.org/
