## Reproducible Research is part of several large trends (1)

- Openness
- Transparency
- Quality: reproducibility
- Collaboration / Team work
- Communication

---

## Reproducible Research is part of several large trends (2)

We are in the middle of an exponential growth curve:

- Data production
- Data storage and transfer
- Computing power
- Published research
- Complexity of methods

---

## Reproducible Research is part of several large trends (3)

- Industrialisation of the research work flow
- Specialisation in research tasks

## Reproducible Research is part of several large trends (5)

- Changes in the way we work:
	- Remote work
	- Online communities
	- Ad hoc teams

- Research on research:
	- Meta analysis (your output is somebody else's input)
	- Metaresearch: evidence based development of research methods

## There are still very strong barriers

- Tools needed
- Tradition, culture and common practices need to change
- Researchers need to see the value in adopting an open, reproducible workflow
- Training and reward systems need to be adapted:
	- Publication
	- Academic recognition / careers
	- Research funding mechanisms
- Law: privacy concerns about sharing data, IP protection, patents, etc
