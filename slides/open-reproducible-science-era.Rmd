# Open science and reproducibility are some of multiple large trends

## Like quality/rigor, team science, communication, computing, data, meta-analysis, and meta-research

???

We are in the middle of several exponential growth curves:

- Higher demands for transparency and rigor in research
- Higher need for (potentially highly distributed and virtual) team science 
- Higher public attention with Internet and social media
- Higher computing power and massive datasets, leading to rise of machine learning and AI
- Meta-analysis where your output is someone else's in
- Research on research:
	- Meta analysis (your output is somebody else's input)
	- Metaresearch: evidence-based evaluation and development of research methods
	
???
- Quality: Reproducibility and replicability
Collaboration / Team work / Remote work
Communication / Public Engagement / Social Media

# Activity

- Consider times either tried to reproduce labmates work or your own
- Or got code from another labmate and had no idea what was going on
- Or your own, older code.


- think of times you've tried to find code or more detail about how a publication
or even your group has done something and its next to impossible to find.

# Code sharing is abysmal across health sciences `r Cite(bib, c("Considine2017a", "Leek2017a", "Seibold2021"))`

## How can we check reproducibility if no code is given?

???

But that doesn't even matter, because we can't have reproducibility if no one shares
their code!

And this is no joke. Getting data on this is difficult, but the research that has
been done shows that almost no one is sharing their code. The estimates range 
between fields in health science from zero to maybe five percent of published
studies. The only area that is doing pretty well is bioinformatics, at about 60%
of published studies.

We as researchers try to find our niche, make our own space in the research world.
Sometimes its a real struggle to find that niche.. but guys! No one is doing this,
no one is sharing their code! You start doing the simplest thing of sharing your
code and you will be one of very very few people who do. And this isn't a niche,
this is a gaping hole in our modern scientific process. A huge hole.

## Some journals are moving in this direction

PLOS Computational Biology is running a pilot:


.pull-left[
*"We will soon be able to offer expert technical peer review specifically checking that submitted systems biology or physiology-based models run according to the results presented in the manuscript submitted to the journal. The peer review will be delivered in addition to our usual scientific assessment.."*

## Recent large study on general reproducibility of projects that shared code.

Those in Dataverse.org, so there's some bias in that those who upload are probably
a bit more aware and knowledgeable about general reproducibility and coding then
the average researcher.

Initially only 25% of the R scripts could be *executed* (doesn't mean results were
reproduced though)

# Current scientific culture not prepared for analytic and computation era

## Sadly, not going to lie, there are very strong barriers...


---

## Institutional barriers

???

You will encounter a lot of resistance, a lot of barriers and hardship.

--

- Lack of adequate awareness, support, infrastructure, training

???

At the institutional level, there is no real awareness of this,
no support or infrastructure. You're basically doing this on your own.
Which probably isn't that uncommon anyway.

--

- Research culture values publications over all else

???

Research culture and incentives pretty much only care about publishing journal
articles. Creating software tools or datasets to be shared, meh. Making teaching
materials to help other researchers, meh. Communicating your science to the
public and doing outreach, meh. Doing actual science that might take years and
not lead to any "hard papers", meh.

--

- Legal and privacy concerns about sharing data, intellectual property
protection, patents, etc

???

Legal and privacy concerns are big topics that institutions in particular
focus on a lot, about ownership and so on, since research can lead to commercialization
and the potential for profit. For individual researchers, we often worry about
these concerns too much and sometimes stops us from doing work because we're
afraid we're doing something wrong

--

- More traditional academics don't understand or resist change

???

We have a large portion of traditional academics who have benefited from and
succeeded in this system and are invested in continuing it. They often say
there's nothing wrong with the system. This is what we in epidemiology call
"survivorship bias". There's nothing wrong, for them, because they succeeded. But
all the others that didn't succeed? We don't count that data. 

--

- 'Business as usual' is easier

???

We have a system that favours each individual person repeating the same mistakes
that others make because the system doesn't allow for us to take the time to
create tools and infrastructure that helps ourselves and others out.

Because business as usual is the easiest way in the short term. Our current
scientific culture is just not prepared for this, for the rising modern analytic
and computational era.

---

## ...and personal barriers

.pull-left[
- Fear of:
    - Fear of being scooped or ideas being stolen
    - Not being credited for ideas
    - Errors and public humiliation
    - Risk to reputation
]

???

And there aren't just institutional barriers. We as researchers have fears of
being scooped, of embarrassment and humiliation for your methods being *gasp*
wrong. Which is actually just part of science.

--

.pull-right[
- Overwhelmed with everything that needs to be done

- Need to constantly stay updated

- Finding better opportunities outside of academia
]

???

It is also really overwhelming, having so many things to think about to make sure
you're doing solid science. No researcher in the past had to consider and think
and know as much as we have to know and to do. Another reason why we need more
team science, to distribute the tasks and skills.

You also have to constantly stay updated, and that can be tiring.

And the last barrier, which may actually be a benefit, is that one reason you
don't see a lot of researchers sharing their code or being more reproducible
is.. they end up getting picked up by industry and paid really well or decide
to leave academia for the reasons I mentioned. 

Just as an example, I found a Norwegian group who had a really inefficient 
workflow and decided to re-build their workflow to make use of programming,
to be reproducible, to have a pipeline. I looked up the lead author as well as 
several other of the co-authors and guess what... many of them now work in really
great companies as data scientists or software engineers, probably making a lot 
of money and having potentially a less stressful life.

## Activity: Think `r emo::ji("thought_balloon")` than discuss `r fontawesome::fa("far fa-comments")`

> Imagine if the number of publications and where you published didn't matter
for getting funding or getting a research job. 

- Take 2 minutes (instructor will set time) and consider:
    - What would you spend your time on? 
    - What would you do differently compared to now?

- *With your neighbour*, share what you've thought
    - Each person has 2 minutes
    
- After, we'll share some of the thoughts

# So... what can you do right now?

## Easiest thing: Start sharing your code

.footnote[No matter how ugly. It also doesn't mean it'll be reproducible, but
at least it will be *inspectable*. ]

???

If you do nothing else: share your code.

If its ugly, that's fine! The point is you start and that you get more
comfortable doing it until it becomes second nature to share and in the process,
your code gets better because you know someone might look at your code. 

And even if your code isn't reproducible, even if others can't run it own their 
own, sharing is the first step to becoming better. At the least, others can
inspect your code for its overall logic.

---

## How do you share?

.pull-left[
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)

- [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/)

- [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)

- [figshare](https://figshare.com/)

- [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/)
]

???

How do you share? Put your code up on any of these sites. I prefer a combination
of GitHub and Zenodo, but the others are also quite good as well. And we're 
already showing you how to use GitHub, so you're one step closer to sharing
on your own!

--

.pull-right[
**Yea, but when do you share?**
]

???

Next question might, when do you share? I say right away. As soon as I have an
analysis project, my code is up on either GitHub or GitLab (another service like
GitHub). Alternatively, you can upload it when you also finish your manuscript.
