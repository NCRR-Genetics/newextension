## Open Science is part of several large trends

- Openness / Transparency
- Quality: Reproducibility and replicability
- Collaboration / Team work / Remote work
- Communication / Public Engagement / Social Media

## Open Science is part of several large trends

We are in the middle of several exponential growth curves:

- Data production
- Data storage and transfer
- Computing power
- Published research
- Complexity of methods (e.g. AI)

---

## Open Science is part of several large trends

- Industrialisation of the research work flow
- Specialisation in research tasks

## Open Science is part of several large trends

- Changes in the way we work:
	- Remote work
	- Online communities
	- Ad hoc teams

- Research on research:
	- Meta analysis (your output is somebody else's input)
	- Metaresearch: evidence-based evaluation and development of research methods

## How do we move towards reproducibility?

## Some journals are moving in this direction

PLOS Computational Biology is running a pilot:

*"We will soon be able to offer expert technical peer review specifically checking that submitted systems biology or physiology-based models run according to the results presented in the manuscript submitted to the journal. The peer review will be delivered in addition to our usual scientific assessment.."*

## Developments in making manuscripts interactive

- "[Explorable Multiverse Analysis]" and [example Likert scales]

## There are still very strong barriers

--

- Lack of awareness
- Tradition, culture and common practices need to change
- 'Business as usual' seems the shortest route to success

--

- Tools and training in specific skills needed
- Takes time and dedicated funding

--

- Researchers need to see the value in adopting an open reproducible workflow
- Funding and reward systems need to be adapted:
	- Peer review and Publication
	- Academic recognition / careers
	- Research funding mechanisms

--

- Law: privacy concerns about sharing data, IP protection, patents, etc

---

## Personal barriers

Fear of:

- Scooping or ideas being stolen
- Not being credited for ideas
- Errors and public humiliation
- Risk to reputation
- Reduced scientific quality
- Information overload

## Open science debates and initiatives don't recognize role of software

.footnote[E.g. [EU H2020 Open Science Mandate] only mentions data and publications.]

## What does it mean for you?

- Need to stay updated: Keep learning
    - Read [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) books (most free)
    - Ask (and answer!) questions on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
    - Teach others!! Great way to learn
    - Read e.g. [Open Science Handbook](https://open-science-training-handbook.gitbook.io/book/)

--

- Find and collaborate with those familiar with these concepts (online and/or in real life)

--

- Cite research that is or tries to be more reproducible

--

- Keep the principles of reproducibility in mind, then find the tools

--

- Practice reproducible and open science
    - More on this later in session
