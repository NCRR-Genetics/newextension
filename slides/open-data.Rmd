## Where is Open Data in the Open Science Universe?

- Open data is only a small part of the open science movement

## Open Data Principles

.pull-left[
- Open data is not only about datasets you can download from the internet

- Accessibility is only one part of Openness

## Open Data Principles

.pull-left[
- Open data is not only about datasets you can download from the internet

- Accessibility is only one part of Openness

- Open data should be FAIR[1]:
  - Findable
  - Accessible
  - Interoperable
  - Reusable

## FAIR data[1]

- **Findable**:
  The first step in (re)using data is to find them. Metadata and data should be easy to find for both humans and computers.

- **Accessible**:
  Once the user finds the required data, she/he needs to know **how** can they be accessed, possibly including authentication and authorisation.

- **Interoperable**:
  The data usually need to interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing. (Meta)data should use a formal, accessible, shared language or format

- **Reusable**:
  Data and metadata should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings.

## Finding Open data

- Starting points:
    - Data Resources known in your network
    - Publication with link to data source / repository
    - Search in public repositories

---

## Known data resources

- Wide range of options between fully closed and fully open (FAIR)
    - Closed

## Publications with links to data

Journals increasingly encourage publication of (links to) data

Let's have a look at the PLOS journals:

- Policy requiring researchers to share the data underlying their results or to state why this is not possible
- But: Are authors complying with these requirements? [(PLOS Medicine: Diabetes)](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/search?filterJournals=PLoSMedicine&filterSubjects=Medicine+and%20health%20sciences&filterArticleTypes=Research%20Article&q=diabetes&page=1)

## How are you allowed to use data you find?

- First important step: know who 'owns' the data and what they allow you to do with it
    - Public Domain: There is no owner, you are allowed to use the data in any way
    - Data are protected by copyright: but the owner gives you a license to use it in a certain way
  
- Different Open Licenses

.pull-left[
```{r, out.height="70%", out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/CC_licenses.png")
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, out.height="30%", out.width="30%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/CClicense_range.png")
```
]

---

## Different Open Licenses

.pull-left[
For any type of 'work', including databases:

- Creative Commons:
    - CC BY-NC (Attribution-NonCommercial)
    - CC BY-ND (Attribution-NoDerivatives)
    - CC BY-SA (Attribution-ShareAlike)
    - CC-BY (only Attribution required)
    - CC0 (= placing something in the public domain)
- Open Data Commons Licenses:
    - ODC-By (Attribution required)
    - PDDL (= placing a database in the public domain)
]
.pull-right[
Mostly for Open Source Software:

- GNU
- MIT

## Summary

- Open Data is only a part of the Open Science Universe
- Open Data should be FAIR (but are often only in part)
- There are many different ways of finding Open Data, none are ideal (yet)
- Be mindful of the licence attached to a dataset
