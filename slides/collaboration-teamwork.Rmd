## What is collaboration?

-   Multiple people working on the same problem and exchanging ideas
-   People pooling expertise, time and resources to achieve a common goal

For example:

-   Two researchers jointly writing a paper
-   Several labs working on a problem together
-   Multi-site clinical studies in several countries

Collaboration can be organised at different levels:
-   Individuals
-   Departments
-   Institutions
-   Countries

---
## Why collaborate?

-   Sharing and discussing different perspectives and ideas leads to solutions more rapidly

-   Large undertakings require a joint effort: Many hands make light work

-   Teams with the best mix of competences

-   Access to specific material, equipment or know-how

-   Some projects need geographic distribution or capacity of parallel sites

-   Collaborations publish more and get more citations

-   Working together can be more motivating than solitary work

## Collaboration is based on agreement

Agreement is needed on:
-   Goals
-   Participants, their roles and responsibilities
-   Timing and deadlines
-   Commitment of time and resources
-   Expectations on quality
-   Data sharing, ownership, access
-   Intellectual property rights
-   Publication of results and authorships

## Collaboration happens at different places in the research workflow

Where in this research workflow can collaborative research methods be relevant?
