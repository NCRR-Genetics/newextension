## What is collaboration?

-   Multiple people working on the same problem and exchanging ideas
-   People pooling expertise, time and resources to achieve a common goal

.pull-left[
For example:
-   Two researchers jointly writing a paper
-   Several labs working on a problem together
-   Multi-site clinical studies in several countries
]

Collaboration can be organised at different levels: Individuals,
Departments, Institutions, Countries

## Collaboration is the consequence of specialisation

- Increasing complexity of the research work flow
- Specialisation in research tasks

## Why do researchers collaborate?

-   Sharing and discussing different perspectives and ideas leads to solutions more rapidly

-   Large undertakings require a joint effort: Many hands make light work

-   Teams with the best mix of competences

-   Access to specific material, equipment or know-how

-   Some projects need geographic distribution or capacity of parallel sites

-   Collaborations publish more and get more citations

-   Working together can be more motivating than solitary work

## Collaboration throughout the research cycle: Initiation

Agreement is needed on:
-   Goals
-   Participants, their roles and responsibilities
-   Timing and deadlines
-   Commitment of time and resources
-   Expectations on quality
-   Data sharing, ownership, access
-   Intellectual property rights
-   Publication of results and authorships

## Summary

- Collaboration is central to modern science

- Enormous variation in scale and scope

- Central aim: Efficient coordination

- Takes place at every stage of the research cycle

- Central tools:
    - Good communication
    - Agreement not just on goals but on process:
      - The Coordinated Work Environment 
    - Structured documentation
