## There are enormous benefits to being open!

.pull-left[
- Sharing code and/or data:
    - Pushes you to make things correct, understandable, organized
    - Gets more visibility, potential collaborations [1]
    - Better science with more transparency
    - Your work doesn't rot away if you move elsewhere
]

--

.pull-right[
- Using preprints [2]:
    - More impact to you and your career
    - Sooner release of research, sooner on your CV
    - More citations, visibility, scientific priority/precedence [3]
    - Funders increasingly requesting it (e.g. Plan S from EU)

]

.footnote[
[1] Depends on the field, which may have their own repositories. See this
[list of repositories](https://www.nature.com/sdata/policies/repositories)
to use. Also, make sure your data conforms to GDPR (pseudoanonymization,
anonymization) before sharing.  
[2] Pre-registering makes science better: More [null findings](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07118-1) 
from studies that pre-registered... which is a *great thing*!!

### How many have published something and signed their copyright over to the journal?

???

Anyone think that's... weird or wrong?

Journals don't need to do that. There is nothing legally necessary for them to 
take your copyrighted work.

## Licensing

.right-column[
### Make sure to consider licensing and copyright for maximum impact

- Code: **[MIT] (recommended)** or [GPL]

- Posters, slides, manuscripts: [CC-BY] \[1\]

- Data [2]: [CC0] or [Open Data Commons]

.footnote[
[1] As best you can, don't give away the copyright of *your* research and work
to journals! Lots of great journals out there that don't do that.

## But, there are many challenges

- Mostly [cultural] pushback
    - Traditional scientists may not understand
    - Fear of "scooping", no strong incentives (yet)
    - Lots of new things to learn

--

- Lack of awareness that data and code are foundation of good science...
    - Not the publication, the findings, or journal "impact factor"
    - [Awareness even less for code](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4579)

--

- It's hard to do open and reproducible science
    - Those who do open data and are rigorous about it, but don't share code,
    [only 35% were easily reproducible](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.180448)

--

- What really is stopping you?
    - 50-80% of PhD and post-docs move into industry [1]
    - Being open and showing your work can *only help!*

--

> But, the key is that this **is** the future of science

???

Question: How many intend to stay in academia?
