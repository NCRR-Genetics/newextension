## What next?

It is one thing to learn the principles of how to do reproducible
research. It is quite another thing to do so in daily practice. So, how
can we practice these skills and tools we learned during the course?

-   If you have your own data already, then it's easy: Just start using
    these tools bit by bit. Slowly and steadily use the tools from this
    course and continue learning. It isn't a race, use what you can
    without getting totally overwhelmed.
-   If you don't have access to your data yet, check out Section
    \@ref(further-learning) in the Resources Appendix \@ref(resources).
-   If your collaborators or supervisor don't use these tools from the
    course, are not supportive, or are supportive but not able to learn
    and use these tools themselves, e.g. they are too busy, there are
    several steps you can take. This situtation is definitely
    challenging and is likely to be most commonly encountered. Use the
    tools as best you can, small bits at a time, so you continue
    learning but don't get completely overwhelmed with all the new
    things and ways to do things. Below are some potential small steps
    to take that you can choose from to start incorporating and using R
    and reproducibility in your work:
    -   As much as possible, setup your projects, folders, and files in
        a more reproducible way (e.g. through using the structure
        created from the prodigenr package).
    -   Create all your figures entirely in R and using R scripts or R
        Markdown files.
    -   Write everything research related in R Markdown and convert to a
        Word document when you need to send to co-authors. If they make
        edits or comments, include the edits in the original R Markdown
        file, and *do not* keep them in the Word document.
    -   Start slowly making use of Git, even if you can't or are not
        comfortable yet with sharing on GitHub. Git and GitHub are two
        separate things and Git can still be used on your computer
        without putting it up online.
    -   Use R entirely to wrangle and clean your data rather than, e.g.
        opening up Excel and editing the data there.
-   If you're restricted to working with your data in a virtual remote
    environment (e.g. in Denmark Statistics), you may not have
    authorization to install some programs. However, most remote
    environments have the latest software used for data analysis type
    tasks. Check out Section \@ref(real-world-r3) below for details
    about doing reproducible research with R in the Denmark Statistics
    servers.
