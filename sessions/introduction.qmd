for some it may feel a bit slow. Remember, this is an introduction
course, so we're assuming little to no knowledge on these things. We're
assuming no prior knowledge, so for those with some knowledge, it will
feel slow at times.

We are in the middle of several exponential growth curves:

-   Higher demands for transparency and rigor in research
-   Higher need for (potentially highly distributed and virtual) team
    science
-   Higher public attention with Internet and social media
-   Higher computing power and massive datasets, leading to rise of
    machine learning and AI
-   Meta-analysis where your output is someone else's input
-   Meta-research: evidence-based evaluation and development of research
    methods
